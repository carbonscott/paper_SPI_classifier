However, significant time and effort are still required to solve and complete many of these structures because of the need for manual interpretation of complex numerical data using many software packages and the repeated use of interactive three-dimensional graphics.               PHENIX               has been developed to provide a comprehensive system for macromolecular crystallographic structure solution with an emphasis on the automation of all procedures. This has relied on the development of algorithms that minimize or eliminate subjective input, the development of algorithms that automate procedures that are traditionally performed by hand and, finally, the development of a framework that allows a tight integration between the algorithms.},

It is believed that a decrease in membrane lipid fluidity activates the DesK/DesR signal transduction cascade, which results in synthesis of the {$\Delta$}5 acyl lipid desaturase and desaturation of membrane phospholipids. These newly synthesized unsaturated fatty acids then act as negative signals of               des               transcription, thus generating a regulatory metabolic loop that optimizes membrane fluidity. We previously suggested that DesK is a bifunctional enzyme with both kinase and phosphatase activities that could assume different signaling states in response to changes in the fluidity of membrane lipids. However, no direct experimental evidence supported this proposed model. In this study, we show that the C-terminal fragment of the DesK protein (DesKC) indeed acts as an autokinase. Addition of the response regulator DesR to phosphorylated DesKC resulted in rapid transfer of the phosphoryl group to DesR. Further, phosphorylated DesR can be dephosphorylated in the presence of DesKC, thus demonstrating that the sensor kinase has the ability to covalently modify DesR through both kinase and phosphatase activities. We also present evidence that DesKC might be locked in a kinase-dominant state in vivo and that its activities are not affected either in vivo or in vitro by unsaturated fatty acids. These findings provide the first direct evidence that the transmembrane segments of DesK are essential to sense changes in membrane fluidity and for regulating the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activities of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.},

Existing methods were modified to cope with the shortcomings of the experimental data: inaccessibility of information from half of the detector and a small fraction of single hits. The general SPI analysis workflow was upgraded with the expectation-maximization based classification of diffraction patterns and mode decomposition on the final virus-structure determination step. The presented processing pipeline allowed us to determine the 3D structure of bacteriophage PR772 without symmetry constraints with a spatial resolution of 6.9\hspace{0.25em}nm. The obtained resolution was limited by the scattering intensity during the experiment and the relatively small number of single hits.},

  abstract = {Phasing by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) from multiple crystallographic data sets can be particularly demanding because of the weak anomalous signal and possible non-isomorphism. The identification and exclusion of non-isomorphous data sets by suitable indicators is therefore indispensable. Here, simple and robust data-selection methods are described. A multi-dimensional scaling procedure is first used to identify data sets with large non-isomorphism relative to clusters of other data sets. Within each cluster that it identifies, further selection is based on the weighted {$\Delta$}CC               1/2               , a quantity representing the influence of a set of reflections on the overall CC               1/2               of the merged data. The anomalous signal is further improved by optimizing the scaling protocol. The success of iterating the selection and scaling steps was verified by substructure determination and subsequent structure solution. Three serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) SAD test cases with hundreds of partial data sets and one test case with 62 complete data sets were analyzed. Structure solution was dramatically simplified with this procedure, and enabled solution of the structures after a few selection/scaling iterations. To explore the limits, the procedure was tested with much fewer data than originally required and could still solve the structure in several cases. In addition, an SSX data challenge, minimizing the number of (simulated) data sets necessary to solve the structure, was significantly underbid.},

Numerous helper functions enable comparative analysis of experimental and theoretical data, and visualization of the principal changes in conformations that are accessible in different functional states. ProDy application programming interface (API) has been designed so that users can easily extend the software and implement new methods.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are small, linear tetrapyrrole (bilin)-binding photoreceptors in the phytochrome superfamily that regulate diverse light-mediated adaptive processes in cyanobacteria. More spectrally diverse than canonical red/far-red\textendash sensing phytochromes, CBCRs were thought to be restricted to sensing visible and near UV light until recently when several subfamilies with far-red\textendash sensing representatives (frCBCRs) were discovered. Two of these frCBCRs subfamilies have been shown to incorporate bilin precursors with larger pi-conjugated chromophores, while the third frCBCR subfamily uses the same phycocyanobilin precursor found in the bulk of the known CBCRs. To elucidate the molecular basis of far-red light perception by this third frCBCR subfamily, we determined the crystal structure of the far-red\textendash absorbing dark state of one such frCBCR Anacy\_2551g3 from               Anabaena cylindrica               PCC 7122 which exhibits a reversible far-red/orange photocycle. Determined by room temperature serial crystallography and cryocrystallography, the refined 2.7-\AA{} structure reveals an unusual               all-Z,syn               configuration of the phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore that is considerably less extended than those of previously characterized red-light sensors in the phytochrome superfamily. Based on structural and spectroscopic comparisons with other bilin-binding proteins together with site-directed mutagenesis data, our studies reveal protein\textendash chromophore interactions that are critical for the atypical bathochromic shift. Based on these analyses, we propose that far-red absorption in Anacy\_2551g3 is the result of the additive effect of two distinct red-shift mechanisms involving cationic bilin lactim tautomers stabilized by a constrained               all-Z,syn c               onformation and specific interactions with a highly conserved anionic residue.},

The molecular basis of far-red (FR) light perception by cyanobacteriochromes is currently unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a far-red-sensing cyanobacteriochrome from Anabaena cylindrica PCC 7122, which exhibits a reversible far-red/orange photocycle. The 2.7 A structure of its FR-absorbing dark state, determined by room temperature serial crystallography and cryo-crystallography, reveals an all-Z,syn configuration of its bound linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore that is less extended than the bilin chromophores of all known phytochromes. Based on structural comparisons with other bilin-binding proteins and extensive spectral analyses on mutants, we identify key protein- chromophore interactions that enable far-red sensing in bilin-binding proteins. We propose that FR-CBCRs employ two distinct tuning mechanisms, which work together to produce a large batho-chromatic shift. Findings of this work have important implications for development and improvement of photoproteins with far-red absorption and fluorescence.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is that the orientations adopted by the 3D particles prior to imaging are unknown; yet, this knowledge is essential for high-resolution reconstruction. We present a method to recover these orientations directly from the acquired set of 2D projections. Our approach consists of two steps: (i) the estimation of distances between pairs of projections, and (ii) the recovery of the orientation of each projection from these distances. In step (i), pairwise distances are estimated by a Siamese neural network trained on synthetic cryo-EM projections from resolved bio-structures. In step (ii), orientations are recovered by minimizing the difference between the distances estimated from the projections and the distances induced by the recovered orientations. We evaluated the method on synthetic cryo-EM datasets. Current results demonstrate that orientations can be accurately recovered from projections that are shifted and corrupted with a high level of noise. The accuracy of the recovery depends on the accuracy of the distance estimator. While not yet deployed in a real experimental setup, the proposed method offers a novel learning-based take on orientation recovery in SPA. Our code is available at https://github.com/JelenaBanjac/protein-reconstruction.},

Even helices with large radius of curvature are unambiguously identified as being linear or curved. The program can also be used to differentiate a kinked helix and other motifs, such as helixloop-helix or a helix-turn-helix (with a single residue linker) with the help of local bending angles. In addition to these, the program can also be used to characterise the helix start and end as well as other types of secondary structures.},

  abstract = {The primary goal of rational drug discovery is the identification of selective ligands which act on single or multiple drug targets to achieve the desired clinical outcome through the exploration of total chemical space. To identify such desired compounds, computational approaches are necessary in predicting their drug-like properties. G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the largest and most important integral membrane protein families. These receptors serve as increasingly attractive drug targets due to their relevance in the treatment of various diseases, such as inflammatory disorders, metabolic imbalances, cardiac disorders, cancer, monogenic disorders, etc. In the last decade, multitudes of three-dimensional (3D) structures were solved for diverse GPCRs, thus referring to this period as the ``golden age for GPCR structural biology.'' Moreover, accumulation of data about the chemical properties of GPCR ligands has garnered much interest toward the exploration of GPCR chemical space. Due to the steady increase in the structural, ligand, and functional data of GPCRs, several cheminformatics approaches have been implemented in its drug discovery pipeline. In this review, we mainly focus on the cheminformatics-based paradigms in GPCR drug discovery. We provide a comprehensive view on the ligand\textendash{} and structure-based cheminformatics approaches which are best illustrated via GPCR case studies. Furthermore, an appropriate combination of ligand-based knowledge with structure-based ones, i.e., integrated approach, which is emerging as a promising strategy for cheminformatics-based GPCR drug design is also discussed.},

It is a great challenge to classify this information and reduce the initial data set to a manageable size for further analysis. Here an approach for classification of diffraction patterns measured in prototypical diffract-and-destroy single-particle imaging experiments at XFELs is presented. It is proposed that the data are classified on the basis of a set of parameters that take into account the underlying diffraction physics and specific relations between the real-space structure of a particle and its reciprocal-space intensity distribution. The approach is demonstrated by applying principal component analysis and support vector machine algorithms to the simulated and measured X-ray data sets.},

Photo-transformable fluorescent proteins (PTFPs), in particular, recently attracted wide interest, as their fluorescence state can be actively modulated by light, a property central to the emergence of super-resolution microscopy. PTFPs, however, exhibit highly complex photophysical behaviours that are still poorly understood, hampering the rational engineering of variants with improved performances. We show that kinetic crystallography combined with in crystallo optical spectroscopy, modeling approaches and single-molecule measurements constitutes a powerful tool to decipher processes such as photoactivation, photoconversion, photoswitching, photoblinking and photobleaching. Besides potential applications for the design of enhanced PTFPs, these investigations provide fundamental insight into photoactivated protein dynamics.},

Since the first structural analysis of diffraction patterns, computer calculations have been an important tool in these studies (Blundell \& Johnson, 1976). As is described by Sheldrick (1985), it has been taken for granted that a necessary first step in the determination of a protein structure would be writing computer programs to fit structure factors. In contrast the combined use of the structural analysis of NMR data and computer calculations has been quite limited. An early attempt of such structural calculations was the quantitative determination of mononucleotide conformations in solution using lanthanide ion shifts (Barry               et al               . 1971).},

  abstract = {Background: Further advances in modern microscopy are leading to teravoxel-sized tiled 3D images at high resolution, thus increasing the dimension of the stitching problem of at least two orders of magnitude. The existing software solutions do not seem adequate to address the additional requirements arising from these datasets, such as the minimization of memory usage and the need to process just a small portion of data. Results: We propose a free and fully automated 3D Stitching tool designed to match the special requirements coming out of teravoxel-sized tiled microscopy images that is able to stitch them in a reasonable time even on workstations with limited resources. The tool was tested on teravoxel-sized whole mouse brain images with micrometer resolution and it was also compared with the state-of-the-art stitching tools on megavoxel-sized publicy available datasets. This comparison confirmed that the solutions we adopted are suited for stitching very large images and also perform well on datasets with different characteristics. Indeed, some of the algorithms embedded in other stitching tools could be easily integrated in our framework if they turned out to be more effective on other classes of images. To this purpose, we designed a software architecture which separates the strategies that use efficiently memory resources from the algorithms which may depend on the characteristics of the acquired images. Conclusions: TeraStitcher is a free tool that enables the stitching of Teravoxel-sized tiled microscopy images even on workstations with relatively limited resources of memory ({$<$} 8 GB) and processing power. It exploits the knowledge of approximate tile positions and uses ad-hoc strategies and algorithms designed for such very large datasets. The produced images can be saved into a multiresolution representation to be efficiently retrieved and processed. We provide TeraStitcher both as standalone application and as plugin of the free software Vaa3D.},

Our data show that the particle motion is correlated within patches of 0.3 \textendash{} 0.5 {$\mu$}m, indicating that the whole ice layer is moving in a drum-like motion, with accompanying particle rotations of up to a few degrees. Support films with smaller holes, as well as lower electron dose rates tend to reduce beam-induced specimen motion, consistent with a mechanical effect. Finally, analysis of movies showing changes in the specimen during beam exposure show that the specimen moves significantly more at the start of an exposure than towards its end. We show how alignment and averaging of movie frames can be used to restore high-resolution detail in images affected by beam-induced motion.},

The signature verification algorithm is based on an artificial neural network.

During training the network learns to measure the similarity between pairs of signatures. When used for verification, only one half of the Siamese network is evaluated. The output of this half network is the feature vector for the input signature. Verification consists of comparing this feature vector with a stored feature vector for the signer. Signatures closer than a chosen threshold to this stored representation are accepted, all other signatures are rejected as forgeries.

Here, we show that RGC1 and RGC2 function as light-activated cyclases only upon heterodimerization with RGC3 (NeoR). RGC1/2 utilize conventional green or blue-light-sensitive rhodopsins (               {$\lambda$}               max               \,=\,550 and 480\,nm, respectively), with short-lived signaling states, responsible for light-activation of the enzyme. The bistable NeoR is photoswitchable between a near-infrared-sensitive (NIR,               {$\lambda$}               max               \,=\,690\,nm) highly fluorescent state (               Q               F               \,=\,0.2) and a UV-sensitive non-fluorescent state, thereby modulating the activity by NIR pre-illumination. No other rhodopsin has been reported so far to be functional as a~heterooligomer, or as having such a long wavelength absorption or high fluorescence yield. Site-specific mutagenesis and hybrid~quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics~simulations support the idea that the unusual photochemical properties result from the rigidity of the retinal chromophore and a unique counterion triad composed of two glutamic and one aspartic acids. These findings substantially expand our understanding of the natural potential and limitations of spectral tuning in rhodopsin photoreceptors.},

However, beam time at these facilities is scarce, and involved sample delivery techniques are required. On the other hand, rotation electron diffraction (MicroED) has shown great potential as an alternative means for protein nano-crystallography. Here, we present a method for serial electron diffraction of protein nanocrystals combining the benefits of both approaches. In a scanning transmission electron microscope, crystals randomly dispersed on a sample grid are automatically mapped, and a diffraction pattern at fixed orientation is recorded from each at a high acquisition rate. Dose fractionation ensures minimal radiation damage effects. We demonstrate the method by solving the structure of granulovirus occlusion bodies and lysozyme to resolutions of 1.55\,\AA{} and 1.80\,\AA, respectively. Our method promises to provide rapid structure determination for many classes of materials with minimal sample consumption, using readily available instrumentation.},

An application of particular note concerns it use as a medium in which to grow crystals of membrane proteins for structure determination by X-ray crystallography. At least two variations of the mesophase exist. One is the highly viscous cubic phase, which has well developed long-range order. The other so-called sponge phase is considerably more fluid and lacks long-range order. The sponge phase has recently been shown to be a convenient vehicle for delivering microcrystals of membrane proteins to an X-ray free-electron laser beam for serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). Unfortunately, the sponge phase approach calls for large amounts of protein that are not always available in the case of membrane proteins. The cubic phase offers the advantage of requiring significantly less protein for SFX but comes with its own challenges. Here, we describe the physico-chemical bases for these challenges, solutions to them and prospects for future uses of lipidic mesophases in the SFX arena.},

  abstract = {We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Training code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.},

  abstract = {Adenosine receptors (ARs) comprise the P1 class of purinergic receptors and belong to the largest family of integral membrane proteins in the human genome, the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). ARs are classified into four subtypes, A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, which are all activated by extracellular adenosine, and play central roles in a broad range of physiological processes, including sleep regulation, angiogenesis and modulation of the immune system. ARs are potential therapeutic targets in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including sleep disorders, cancer, and dementia, which has made them important targets for structural biology. Over a decade of research and innovation has culminated with the publication of more than 30 crystal structures of the human adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), making it one of the best structurally characterized GPCRs at the atomic level. In this review we analyze the structural data reported for A2AR that described for the first time the binding of mode of antagonists, including newly developed drug candidates, synthetic and endogenous agonists, sodium ions and an engineered G protein. These structures have revealed the key conformational changes induced upon agonist and G protein binding that are central to signal transduction by A2AR, and have highlighted both similarities and differences in the activation mechanism of this receptor compared to other class A GPCRs. Finally, comparison of A2AR with the recently solved structures of A1R has provided the first structural insight into the molecular determinants of ligand binding specificity in different AR subtypes.},

In the present article we wish to evaluate the added value provided through considering structures.                                         Results               We compared the multiple alignments resulting from 25 programs either based on sequence, structure or both, to reference alignments deposited in five databases (BALIBASE 2 and 3, HOMSTRAD, OXBENCH and SISYPHUS). On the whole, the structure-based methods compute more reliable alignments than the sequence-based ones, and even than the sequence+structure-based programs whatever the databases. Two programs lead, MAMMOTH and MATRAS, nevertheless the performances of MUSTANG, MATT, 3DCOMB, TCOFFEE+TM\_ALIGN and TCOFFEE+SAP are better for some alignments. The advantage of structure-based methods increases at low levels of sequence identity, or for residues in regular secondary structures or buried ones. Concerning gap management, sequence-based programs set less gaps than structure-based programs. Concerning the databases, the alignments of the manually built databases are more challenging for the programs.

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers have opened up the possibility of structure determination of protein crystals at room temperature, free of radiation damage. The femtosecond-duration pulses of these sources enable diffraction signals to be collected from samples at doses of 1000 MGy or higher. The sample is vaporized by the intense pulse, but not before the scattering that gives rise to the diffraction pattern takes place. Consequently, only a single flash diffraction pattern can be recorded from a crystal, giving rise to the method of serial crystallography where tens of thousands of patterns are collected from individual crystals that flow across the beam and the patterns are indexed and aggregated into a set of structure factors. The high-dose tolerance and the many-crystal averaging approach allow data to be collected from much smaller crystals than have been examined at synchrotron radiation facilities, even from radiation-sensitive samples. Here, we review the interaction of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses with materials and discuss the implications for structure determination. We identify various dose regimes and conclude that the strongest achievable signals for a given sample are attained at the highest possible dose rates, from highest possible pulse intensities.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Our purpose was to use 3-dimensional (3D) surface photography to quantitatively measure breast cosmesis within the framework of a randomized clinical trial of conventionally fractionated (CF) and hypofractionated (HF) whole breast irradiation (WBI); to identify how 3D measurements are associated with patient- and physician-reported cosmesis; and to determine whether objective measures of breast symmetry varied by WBI treatment arm or transforming growth factor b 1 (TGFb1) status. Methods and Materials: From 2011 to 2014, 287 women age !40 with ductal carcinoma in situ or early-stage invasive breast cancer were enrolled in a multicenter trial and randomized to HF-WBI or CF-WBI with a boost. Three-dimensional surface photography was performed at 3 years posttreatment. Patient-reported cosmetic outcomes were recorded with the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale. Physician-reported cosmetic outcomes were assessed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. Volume ratios and 6 quantitative measures of breast symmetry, termed F1-6C, were calculated using the breast contour and fiducial points assessed on 3D surface images. Associations between all metrics, patient- and physician-reported cosmesis, treatment arm, and TGFb1 genotype were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Among 77 (39 CF-WBI and 38 HF-WBI) evaluable patients, both patient- and physician-reported cosmetic outcomes were significantly associated with the F1C vertical symmetry measure (both P {$<$} .05). Higher dichotomized F1C and volumetric symmetry measures were associated with improved patient- and physician-reported cosmesis on multivariable logistic regression (both P .05). There were no statistically significant differences in vertical symmetry or volume measures between treatment arms. Increased F6C horizontal symmetry was observed in the CF-WBI arm (P Z .05). Patients with the TGFb1 C-509T variant allele had lower F2C vertical symmetry measures (P Z .02). Conclusions: Quantitative 3D image-derived measures revealed comparable cosmetic outcomes with HF-WBI compared with CF-WBI. Our findings suggest that 3D surface imaging may be a more sensitive method for measuring subtle cosmetic changes than global patient- or physician-reported assessments.},

One motivation for the development of such X-ray sources was the proposal to obtain structures of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and virus particles, without the need for crystallization, through diffraction measurements of single noncrystalline objects. Initial explorations of this idea and of outrunning radiation damage with femtosecond pulses led to the development of serial crystallography and the ability to obtain high-resolution structures of small crystals without the need for cryogenic cooling. This technique allows the understanding of conformational dynamics and enzymatics and the resolution of intermediate states in reactions over timescales of 100 fs to minutes. The promise of more photons per atom recorded in a diffraction pattern than electrons per atom contributing to an electron micrograph may enable diffraction measurements of single molecules, although challenges remain.},

This sphere is, in effect, rolled over the molecule to generate a smooth outer-surface contour. This surface contour is made up of pieces of spheres and tort that join at circular arcs. The spheres, tort and arcs are defined by analytical expressions in terms of the atomic coordinates, van der Waals radii and the probe radius. The area of each surface piece may be calculated analytically and the surface may be displayed on either vector or raster computer-graphics systems. These methods are useful for studying the structure and interactions of proteins and nucleic acids.},

  abstract = {Characterization of material properties of human skin is required to develop a physics-based biomechanical model that can predict deformation of female breast after cosmetic and reconstructive surgery. In this paper, we have adopted an experimental approach to characterize the biaxial response of human skin using bulge tests. Skin specimens were harvested from breast and abdominal skin of female subjects who underwent mastectomy and/or reconstruction at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and who provided informed consent. The specimens were tested within 2 h of harvest, and after freezing for different time periods but not exceeding 6 months. Our experimental results show that storage in a freezer at 20 C for up to about 40 days does not lead to changes in the mechanical response of the skin beyond statistical variation. Moreover, displacement at the apex of the bulged specimen versus applied pressure varies significantly between different specimens from the same subject and from different subjects. The bulge test results were used in an inverse optimization procedure in order to calibrate two different constitutive material models \textendash{} the angular integration model proposed by Lanir (1983) and the generalized structure tensor formulation of Gasser et al. (2006). The material parameters were estimated through a cost function that penalized deviations of the displacement and principal curvatures at the apex. Generally, acceptable fits were obtained with both models, although the angular integration model was able to fit the curvatures slightly better than the Gasser et al. model. The range of the model parameters has been extracted for use in physics-based biomechanical models of the breast.},

  abstract = {Translation of environmental cues into cellular behavior is a necessary process in all forms of life. In bacteria, this process frequently involves two-component systems in which a sensor histidine kinase (HK) autophosphorylates in response to a stimulus before subsequently transferring the phosphoryl group to a response regulator that controls downstream effectors. Many details of the molecular mechanisms of HK activation are still unclear due to complications associated with the multiple signaling states of these large, multidomain proteins. To address these challenges, we combined complementary solution biophysical approaches to examine the conformational changes upon activation of a minimal, blue-light\textendash sensing histidine kinase from               Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594               , EL346. Our data show that multiple conformations coexist in the dark state of EL346 in solution, which may explain the enzyme's residual dark-state activity. We also observe that activation involves destabilization of the helices in the dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer-like domain, where the phosphoacceptor histidine resides, and their interactions with the catalytic domain. Similar light-induced changes occur to some extent even in constitutively active or inactive mutants, showing that light sensing can be decoupled from activation of kinase activity. These structural changes mirror those inferred by comparing X-ray crystal structures of inactive and active HK fragments, suggesting that they are at the core of conformational changes leading to HK activation. More broadly, our findings uncover surprising complexity in this simple system and allow us to outline a mechanism of the multiple steps of HK activation.},

By acquiring a large number of ultrashort X-ray exposures on an ensemble of molecules, this technique produces a dataset that contains structural information far beyond what is obtainable from traditional solution scattering methods without requiring crystallization. However, reconstructing the underlying molecular shape from this data is challenging, as the information in each image is averaged over several molecular orientations. In this article, we introduce a flexible iterative method that can rapidly determine molecular structure from fluctuation scattering data. This allows one to visualize structural details that may be inaccessible through traditional methods.           ,              Fluctuation X-ray scattering (FXS) is an extension of small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering in which the X-ray snapshots are taken below rotational diffusion times. This technique, performed using a free electron laser or ultrabright synchrotron source, provides significantly more experimental information compared with traditional solution scattering methods. We develop a multitiered iterative phasing algorithm to determine the underlying structure of the scattering object from FXS data.},

Since coiled coils can be described fully by parametric equations, they can serve as a reference point for quantifying the conformational space of all square bundles. To this end we have developed a program, samCC, which measures the deviation of a given bundle from an idealized coiled coil and decomposes this into axial rotation and axial, radial, and angular shifts. We present examples of analyses performed with the program and focus in particular on the axial rotation states of helices in coiled coils, in order to gain further insight into a proposed mechanism for transmembrane signal transduction, which involves a 26\textdegree{} axial rotation of helices between a canonical coiled coil and a variant called the Alacoil. We find that, unlike expected from the mechanistic model, coiled coils show a continuum of axial rotation states, suggesting that the Alacoil does not represent a single, defined state. We also find that one of the originally proposed Alacoil proteins, Rop, in fact has canonical packing. SamCC is freely available as a web service at http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/samcc.},

The main challenge for such engineering is that native bacteriophytochromes have very low fluorescence quantum yields because of competing excited-state deactivation processes, which include both the well-known photoisomerization reaction of their linear tetrapyrrole chromophore and excited-state proton transfer reactions from the chromophore to the surrounding protein. Here, we describe how hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics modeling of the photochemistry of these proteins have provided valuable guidelines for strengthening the fluorescence through inhibition of the competing non-radiative processes. Specifically, based on the results of such modeling, we present a strategy to inhibit the photoisomerization on steric grounds and identify the most probable proton transfer reaction to exert a negative influence on the fluorescence quantum yields.

As a result, understanding the molecular basis for their activity is of paramount importance. Recent technological advances have made GPCR structural biology increasingly tractable, offering views of these receptors in unprecedented atomic detail. Structural and biophysical data have shown that GPCRs function as complex allosteric machines, communicating ligand-binding events through conformational change. Changes in receptor conformation lead to activation of effector proteins, such as G proteins and arrestins, which are themselves conformational switches. Here, we review how structural biology has illuminated the agonist-induced cascade of conformational changes that culminate in a cellular response to GPCR activation.},

Remarkably, such recent studies demonstrated that the pulling/stretching forces required to initiate unfolding vary considerably depending on the location of the application of the forces, unraveling residue/position-specific response of proteins to uniaxial tension. Here we show that coarse-grained elastic network models based on the topology of interresidue contacts in the native state can satisfactory explain the relative sizes of such stretching forces exerted on different residue pairs. Despite their simplicity, such models presumably capture a fundamental property that dominates the observed behavior: deformations that can be accommodated by the relatively lower frequency modes of motions intrinsically favored by the structure require weaker forces and vice versa. The mechanical response of proteins to external stress is therefore shown to correlate with the anisotropic fluctuation dynamics intrinsically accessible in the folded state. The dependence on the overall fold implies that evolutionarily related proteins sharing common structural features tend to possess similar mechanical properties. However, the theory cannot explain the differences observed in a number of structurally similar but sequentially distant domains, such as the fibronectin domains.},

  abstract = {Achieving adequate margins during tumor margin resection is critical to minimize the recurrence rate and maximize positive patient outcomes during skin cancer surgery. Although Mohs micrographic surgery is by far the most effective method to treat nonmelanoma skin cancer, it can be limited by its inherent required infrastructure, including time-consuming and expensive on-site histopathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy can accurately detect basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from surrounding normal tissue; however, the biophysical basis of the detection remained unclear. Therefore, we aim to explore the relevant Raman biomarkers to guide BCC margin resection. Raman imaging was performed on skin tissue samples from 30 patients undergoing Mohs surgery. High correlations were found between the histopathology and Raman images for BCC and primary normal structures (including epidermis, dermis, inflamed dermis, hair follicle, hair shaft, sebaceous gland and fat). A previously developed model was used to extract the biochemical changes associated with malignancy. Our results showed that BCC had a significantly different concentration of nucleus, keratin, collagen, triolein and ceramide compared to normal structures. The nucleus accounted for most of the discriminant power (90\% sensitivity, 92\% specificity \textendash{} balanced approach). Our findings suggest that Raman spectroscopy is a promising surgical guidance tool for identifying tumors in the resection margins.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of transmembrane proteins, making them an important target for therapeutics. Activation of these receptors is modulated by orthosteric ligands, which stabilize one or several states within a complex conformational ensemble. The intra- and inter-state dynamics, however, is not well documented. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence to measure ligand-modulated conformational dynamics of the adenosine A               2A               receptor (A               2A               R) on nanosecond to millisecond timescales. Experiments were performed on detergent-purified A               2               R in either the ligand-free (apo) state, or when bound to an inverse, partial or full agonist ligand. Single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) was performed on detergent-solubilized A               2A               R to resolve active and inactive states via the separation between transmembrane (TM) helices 4 and 6. The ligand-dependent changes of the smFRET distributions are consistent with conformational selection and with inter-state exchange lifetimes\,{$\geq$}\,3~ms. Local conformational dynamics around residue 229               6.31               on TM6 was measured using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which captures dynamic quenching due to photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between a covalently-attached dye and proximal aromatic residues. Global analysis of PET-FCS data revealed               fast               (150\textendash 350~ns),               intermediate               (50\textendash 60~{$\mu$}s) and               slow               (200\textendash 300~{$\mu$}s) conformational dynamics in A               2A               R, with lifetimes and amplitudes modulated by ligands and a G-protein mimetic (mini-G               s               ). Most notably, the agonist binding and the coupling to mini-G               s               accelerates and increases the relative contribution of the sub-microsecond phase. Molecular dynamics simulations identified three tyrosine residues (Y112, Y288               7.53               , and Y290               7.55               ) as being responsible for the dynamic quenching observed by PET-FCS and revealed associated helical motions around residue 229               6.31               on TM6. This study provides a quantitative description of conformational dynamics in A               2A               R and supports the idea that ligands bias not only GPCR conformations but also the dynamics within and between distinct conformational states of the receptor.},

  abstract = {The phytochrome family of red/far-red photoreceptors has been optimized to support photochemical isomerization of a bound bilin chromophore, a process that triggers a conformational change and modulates biochemical output from the surrounding protein scaffold. Recent studies have established that the efficiency of this photochemical process is profoundly altered by mutation of a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr176) within the bilin-binding GAF domain of the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 [Fischer, A. J., and Lagarias, J. C. (2004) Harnessing phytochrome's glowing potential, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101, 17334\textendash 17339]. Here, we show that the equivalent mutation in plant phytochromes behaves similarly, indicating that the function of this tyrosine in the primary photochemical mechanism is conserved. Saturation mutagenesis of Tyr176 in Cph1 establishes that no other residue can support comparably efficient photoisomerization. The spectroscopic consequences of Tyr176 mutations also reveal that Tyr176 regulates the conversion of the porphyrinlike conformation of the bilin precursor to a more extended conformation. The porphyrin-binding ability of the Tyr176Arg mutant protein indicates that Tyr176 also regulates the ligand-binding specificity of apophytochrome. On the basis of the hydrogen-bonding ability of Tyr176 substitutions that support the nonphotochemical C15-Z,syn to C15-Z,anti interconversion, we propose that Tyr176 orients the carboxyl side chain of a conserved acidic residue to stabilize protonation of the bilin chromophore. A homology model of the GAF domain of Cph1 predicts a C5-Z,syn, C10Z,syn, C15-Z,anti configuration for the chromophore and implicates Glu189 as the proposed acidic residue stabilizing the extended conformation, an interpretation consistent with site-directed mutagenesis of this conserved acidic residue.},

We show that normal modes calculated in internal coordinate space (ICS) provide better predictions. For a large test set, using the ICS approach describes the conformational changes more completely, and with fewer low-frequency modes than the equivalent Cartesian coordinate modes, despite the fact that the internal coordinate calculations were restricted to torsional angles. This can be attributed to the fact that the use of ICS extends the range over which movements along the corresponding eigenvectors remain close to the true conformational energy hypersurface. We also show that the PaLaCe coarse-grain protein model performs better than a simple elastic network model. We apply ICS normal-mode analysis to protein complexes and, by extending the approach of Sunada and G{$\overline o$}, [Sunada, S.; G{$\overline o$}, N. J. Comput. Chem. 1995, 16, 328-336], we show that we can couple an accurate view of the Cartesian coordinate movements induced by ICS modes with the detection of the key residues responsible for the movements.},

  abstract = {The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that couples to the heterotrimeric G protein GS. Here, we determine the structure by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) of A2AR at pH 7.5 bound to the small molecule agonist NECA and coupled to an engineered heterotrimeric G protein, which contains mini-GS, the {$\beta\gamma$} subunits and nanobody Nb35. Most regions of the complex have a resolution of \textasciitilde 3.8 \AA{} or better. Comparison with the 3.4 \AA{} resolution crystal structure shows that the receptor and mini-GS are virtually identical and that the density of the side chains and ligand are of comparable quality. However, the cryo-EM density map also indicates regions that are flexible in comparison to the crystal structures, which unexpectedly includes regions in the ligand binding pocket. In addition, an interaction between intracellular loop 1 of the receptor and the {$\beta$} subunit of the G protein was observed.},

The method is applied to variable module and constant phase transmittance obstacles in single slit, double slit, square window and round window cases. The method is also applied to an obstacle with a constant reflectance module and random variable phase with Gaussian statistics, which gives rise to speckle phenomenon.},

Exploiting a micrometre-sized X-ray beam, high-precision diffractometry and shutterless data acquisition with a pixel-array detector, a strategy for collecting data from many micrometre-sized crystals presented to an X-ray beam in a vitrified suspension is demonstrated. By combining diffraction data from 80               Trypanosoma brucei               procathepsin B crystals with an average volume of 9\hspace{0.25em}\textmu m               3               , a complete data set to 3.0\hspace{0.25em}\AA{} resolution has been assembled. The data allowed the refinement of a structural model that is consistent with that previously obtained using free-electron laser radiation, providing mutual validation. Further improvements of the serial synchrotron crystallography technique and its combination with serial femtosecond crystallography are discussed that may allow the determination of high-resolution structures of micrometre-sized crystals.},

It can be used in a variety of contexts including measurements made with a monochromatic radiation source, a polychromatic source or with radiation of very short wavelength. As such, the algorithm is particularly suited to automated data processing for two emerging measurement techniques for macromolecular structure determination: serial pink-beam X-ray crystallography and serial electron crystallography, which until now lacked reliable programs for analyzing many individual diffraction patterns from crystals of uncorrelated orientation. The algorithm requires approximate knowledge of the unit-cell parameters of the crystal, but not the wavelengths associated with each Bragg spot. The use of               pinkIndexer               is demonstrated by obtaining 1005 lattices from a published pink-beam serial crystallography data set that had previously yielded 140 indexed lattices.

  abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30\% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012\textemdash achieving a mAP of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/\texttildelow rbg/rcnn.},

Here, we show that although they use the same structural scaffold and share several helix macroswitches, the GPCR classes differ in their microswitch residue positions and contacts. We present molecular mechanistic maps of activation for each GPCR class and new methods for contact analysis applicable for any functional determinants. This is the first superfamily residue-level rationale for conformational selection and allosteric communication by ligands and G proteins laying the foundation for receptor-function studies and drugs with the desired modality.},

Theory and computations have played an instrumental role in understanding the molecular mechanism of such processes, as they provide a molecular-level insight of structural and electronic changes at ultrafast time scales that often are very difficult or impossible to obtain from experiments alone. Among theoretical strategies, the application of hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models is an important approach that has reached an evident degree of maturity, resulting in several important contributions to the field. This review presents an overview of state-of-the-art computational studies on subnanosecond events in rhodopsins, photoactive yellow proteins, phytochromes, and some other photoresponsive proteins where photoinduced double-bond isomerization occurs. The review also discusses current limitations that need to be solved in future developments.},

  abstract = {BioCARS, a NIH-supported national user facility for macromolecular time-resolved X-ray crystallography at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), has recently completed commissioning of an upgraded undulator-based beamline optimized for single-shot laser-pump X-ray-probe measurements with time resolution as short as 100\hspace{0.25em}ps. The source consists of two in-line undulators with periods of 23 and 27\hspace{0.25em}mm that together provide high-flux pink-beam capability at 12\hspace{0.25em}keV as well as first-harmonic coverage from 6.8 to 19\hspace{0.25em}keV. A high-heat-load chopper reduces the average power load on downstream components, thereby preserving the surface figure of a Kirkpatrick\textendash Baez mirror system capable of focusing the X-ray beam to a spot size of 90\hspace{0.25em}\textmu m horizontal by 20\hspace{0.25em}\textmu m vertical. A high-speed chopper isolates single X-ray pulses at 1\hspace{0.25em}kHz in both hybrid and 24-bunch modes of the APS storage ring. In hybrid mode each isolated X-ray pulse delivers up to {$\sim$}4 \texttimes{} 10               10               photons to the sample, thereby achieving a time-averaged flux approaching that of fourth-generation X-FEL sources. A new high-power picosecond laser system delivers pulses tunable over the wavelength range 450\textendash 2000\hspace{0.25em}nm. These pulses are synchronized to the storage-ring RF clock with long-term stability better than 10\hspace{0.25em}ps RMS. Monochromatic experimental capability with Biosafety Level 3 certification has been retained.},

Performance indicators are very useful when the aim is to evaluate and compare different classification models or machine learning techniques. Many metrics come in handy to test the ability of a multi-class classifier. Those metrics turn out to be useful at different stage of the development process, e.g. comparing the performance of two different models or analysing the behaviour of the same model by tuning different parameters. In this white paper we review a list of the most promising multi-class metrics, we highlight their advantages and disadvantages and show their possible usages during the development of a classification model.},

It implements a full processing pipeline including movie processing, image defocus determination, automatic particle picking, 2D classification, ab-initio 3D map generation from random parameters, 3D classification, and high-resolution refinement and reconstruction. Some of these steps implement newly-developed algorithms; others were adapted from previously published algorithms.

Using a 2.6 A\r{} resolution single particle cryo-EM reconstruction of rotavirus VP6, determined from movies recorded with a total exposure of 100 electrons/A\r{} 2, we obtained accurate measurements of optimal exposure values over a wide range of resolutions. At low and intermediate resolutions, our measured values are considerably higher than obtained previously for crystalline specimens, indicating that both images and movies should be collected with higher exposures than are generally used. We demonstrate a method of using our optimal exposure values to filter movie frames, yielding images with improved contrast that lead to higher resolution reconstructions. This `high-exposure' technique should benefit cryo-EM work on all types of samples, especially those of relatively low-molecular mass.},

In structural biology, one of the major applications is serial femtosecond crystallography. The intense XFEL pulse results in the destruction of any exposed microcrystal, making serial data collection mandatory. This requires a high-throughput serial approach to sample delivery. To this end, a number of such sample-delivery techniques have been developed, some of which have been ported to synchrotron sources, where they allow convenient low-dose data collection at room temperature. Here, the current sample-delivery techniques used at XFEL and synchrotron sources are reviewed, with an emphasis on liquid injection and high-viscosity extrusion, including their application for time-resolved experiments. The challenges associated with sample delivery at megahertz repetition-rate XFELs are also outlined.},

HAXIS is based on coarse-graining and spline-fitting of the helix backbone. At each Ca anchor point of the backbone, a Frenet frame is calculated, which directly provides the local vector presentation of the helix. After cubic spline-fitting of the axis line, its curvature and torsion are calculated. This makes a rapid comparison of different helix forms and the determination of helix similarity possible. Distortions of the helix caused by individual residues are projected onto the helix axis and presented either by the rise parameter per residue or by the local curvature of the axis. From a non-redundant set of 2,017 proteins, 15,068 helices were investigated in this way. Helix start and helix end as well as bending and kinking of the helix are accurately described. The global properties of the helix are assessed by a polynomial fit of the helix axis and the determination of its overall curving and twisting. Long helices are more regular shaped and linear whereas short helices are often strongly bent and twisted. The distribution of different helix forms as a function of helix length is analyzed.},

  abstract = {We present CryoGAN, a new paradigm for singleparticle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction based on unsupervised deep adversarial learning. In single-particle cryoEM, the structure of a biomolecule needs to be reconstructed from a large set of noisy tomographic projections with unknown orientations. Current reconstruction techniques are based on a marginalized maximum-likelihood formulation that requires calculations over the set of all possible poses for each projection image, a computationally demanding procedure. Our approach is to seek a 3D structure that has simulated projections that match the real data in a distributional sense, thereby sidestepping pose estimation or marginalization. We prove that, in an idealized mathematical model of cryo-EM, this approach results in recovery of the correct structure. Motivated by distribution matching, we propose CryoGAN, a specialized GAN that consists of a 3D structure, a cryo-EM physics simulator, and a discriminator neural network. During reconstruction, the 3D structure is optimized so that its projections obtained through the simulator resemble real data (to the discriminator). Simultaneously, the discriminator is trained to distinguish real projections from simulated projections. CryoGAN takes as input only real projection images and the distribution of the cryo-EM imaging parameters. It involves neither prior training nor an initial estimation of the 3D structure. CryoGAN currently achieves a 10.8 A\r{} resolution on a realistic synthetic dataset. Preliminary results on experimental {$\beta$}-galactosidase and 80S ribosome data demonstrate the ability of CryoGAN to exploit data statistics under standard experimental imaging conditions. We believe that this paradigm opens the door to a family of novel likelihood-free algorithms for cryo-EM reconstruction.},

  abstract = {The recent development of serial crystallography at synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources is producing crystallographic datasets of ever increasing volume. The size of these datasets is such that fast and efficient analysis presents a range of challenges that have to be overcome to enable real-time data analysis, which is essential for the effective management of XFEL experiments. Among the blocks which constitute the analysis pipeline, one major bottleneck is `peak finding', whose goal is to identify the Bragg peaks within (often) noisy diffraction patterns. Development of faster and more reliable peak-finding algorithms will allow for efficient processing and storage of the incoming data, as well as the optimal use of diffraction data for structure determination. This paper addresses the problem of peak finding and, by extension, `hit finding' in crystallographic XFEL datasets, by exploiting recent developments in robust statistical analysis. The approach described here involves two basic steps: (1) the identification of pixels which contain potential peaks and (2) modeling of the local background in the vicinity of these potential peaks. The presented framework can be generalized to include both complex background models and alternative models for the Bragg peaks.},

The chaotic nature of the emission processes in such sources as well as entirely novel detector demands has also led to significant challenges in terms of data analysis. This paper describes a heuristic approach to datasets where spurious background contributions of a magnitude similar to (or larger) than the signal of interest prevents conventional analysis approaches. The method relies on singular-value decomposition of no-signal subsets of acquired datasets in combination with model inputs and appears generally applicable to time-resolved X-ray diffuse scattering experiments.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

By permitting electron diffraction patterns to be collected from much smaller crystals, or even single well ordered domains of large crystals composed of several small mosaic blocks, MicroED has the potential to overcome the limiting size requirement and enable structural studies on difficult-to-crystallize samples. This communication details the steps for sample preparation, data collection and reduction necessary to obtain refined, high-resolution, three-dimensional models by MicroED, and presents some of its unique challenges.},

In addition, the helical parameters of protein secondary structure elements and nucleic acid helices were analyzed. Generally, at least seven points were required to recapitulate the parameters of a helix using our method. The method can also be used to calculate the helical parameters of nucleic acid-binding proteins, like TALE, enabling direct analysis of their helix complementarity to sequence-dependent DNA distortions.},

  abstract = {The controlled formation of filamentous protein complexes plays a crucial role in many biological systems and represents an emerging paradigm in signal transduction. The mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is a central signal transduction hub in innate immunity that is activated by a receptor-induced conversion into helical superstructures (filaments) assembled from its globular caspase activation and recruitment domain. Solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy has become one of the most powerful techniques for atomic resolution structures of protein fibrils. However, for helical filaments, the determination of the correct symmetry parameters has remained a significant hurdle for any structural technique and could thus far not be precisely derived from ssNMR data. Here, we solved the atomic resolution structure of helical MAVS               CARD               filaments exclusively from ssNMR data. We present a generally applicable approach that systematically explores the helical symmetry space by efficient modeling of the helical structure restrained by interprotomer ssNMR distance restraints. Together with classical automated NMR structure calculation, this allowed us to faithfully determine the symmetry that defines the entire assembly. To validate our structure, we probed the protomer arrangement by solvent paramagnetic resonance enhancement, analysis of chemical shift differences relative to the solution NMR structure of the monomer, and mutagenesis. We provide detailed information on the atomic contacts that determine filament stability and describe mechanistic details on the formation of signaling-competent MAVS filaments from inactive monomers.},

  abstract = {Protein dynamics is pivotal to biological processes. However, experiments are very demanding and difficult to perform, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can still not provide all the answers. This motivates us to analyze protein dynamics in terms of different reduced coordinate representations. We then need to resolve how to reconstruct the full all-atom dynamics from its coarse grained approximation. Accordingly we scrutinize allatom molecular dynamics trajectories in terms of crystallographic Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures, and inquire to what extent is it possible to predict the dynamics of side chain C{$\beta$} atoms in terms of the static properties of backbone C{$\alpha$} and O atoms. Here we find that simulated C{$\beta$} dynamics at near physiological conditions can be reconstructed with very high precision, using the knowledge of the crystallographic backbone C{$\alpha$} and O positions. The precision we can reach with our PDB-based Statistical Method reconstruction exceeds that of popular all-atom reconstruction methods such as Remo and Pulchra, and is fully comparable with the precision of the highly elaborate Scwrl4 all-atom reconstruction method that we have enhanced with the knowledge of the backbone C{$\alpha$} and O atom positions. We then conclude that in a dynamical protein that moves around at physiological conditions, the relative positions of its C{$\beta$} atoms with respect to the backbone C{$\alpha$} and O atoms, deviate very little from their relative positions in static crystallographic PDB structures. This proposes that the dynamics of a biologically active protein could remain subject to very similar, stringent stereochemical constraints that dictate the structure of a folded crystallographic protein. Thus, our results provide a strong impetus to the development of coarse grained techniques that are based on reduced coordinate representations.},

This approach has been applied to two different materials namely nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) and iron oxide (Fe3O4). The recurrent fractal interpolation scheme with variable scaling factors projects and simulates the diffraction pattern more efficiently. The presented work shows that the proposed algorithm is reliable and competitive in simulation and modeling of diffraction pattern.},

Large amounts of data are collected during SPI experiments, driving the need for automated data analysis. The necessary data analysis pipeline has a number of steps including binary object classification (single versus non-single hits). Classification and object detection are areas where deep neural networks currently outperform other approaches. In this work, we use the fast object detector networks YOLOv2 and YOLOv3. By exploiting transfer learning, a moderate amount of data is sufficient to train the neural network. We demonstrate here that a convolutional neural network can be successfully used to classify data from SPI experiments. We compare the results of classification for the two different networks, with different depth and architecture, by applying them to the same SPI data with different data representation. The best results are obtained for diffracted intensity represented by color images on a linear scale using YOLOv2 for classification. It shows an accuracy of about 95\% with precision and recall of about 50\% and 60\%, respectively, in comparison to manual data classification.},

  abstract = {As the only member of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors for which atomic coordinates are available, rhodopsin is widely studied for insight into the molecular mechanism of G-proteincoupled receptor activation. The currently available structures refer to the inactive, dark state, of rhodopsin, rather than the light-activated metarhodopsin II (Meta II) state. A model for the Meta II state is proposed here by analyzing elastic network normal modes in conjunction with experimental data. Key mechanical features and interactions broken/formed in the proposed model are found to be consistent with the experimental data. The model is further tested by using a set of Meta II fluorescence decay rates measured to empirically characterize the deactivation of rhodopsin mutants. The model is found to correctly predict 93\% of the experimentally observed effects in 119 rhodopsin mutants for which the decay rates and misfolding data have been measured, including a systematic analysis of Cys?Ser replacements reported here. Based on the detailed comparison between model and experiments, a cooperative activation mechanism is deduced that couples retinal isomerization to concerted changes in conformation, facilitated by the intrinsic dynamics of rhodopsin. A global hinge site is identified near the retinal-binding pocket that ensures the efficient propagation of signals from the central transmembrane region to both cytoplasmic and extracellular ends. The predicted activation mechanism opens the transmembrane helices at the critical G-protein binding cytoplasmic domain. This model provides a detailed, mechanistic description of the activation process, extending experimental observations and yielding new insights for further tests.

Canonical systems are composed of a transmembrane sensor histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator. They catalyse three reactions: autophosphorylation of the histidine kinase, transfer of the phosphoryl group to the regulator and dephosphorylation of the phosphoregulator. Elucidating signal transduction between sensor and output domains is highly challenging given the size, flexibility and dynamics of histidine kinases. However, recent structural work has provided snapshots of the catalytic mechanisms of the three enzymatic reactions and described the conformation and dynamics of the enzymatic moiety in the kinase-competent and phosphatasecompetent states. Insight into signalling mechanisms across the membrane is also starting to emerge from new crystal structures encompassing both sensor and transducer domains of sensor histidine kinases. In this Progress article, we highlight such important advances towards understanding at the molecular level the signal transduction mechanisms mediated by these fascinating molecular machines.},

  abstract = {Agonist binding promotes activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and association of active receptors with G protein heterotrimers. The resulting active-state ternary complex is the basis for conventional stimulus-response coupling. Although GPCRs can also associate with G proteins before agonist binding, the impact of such preassociated complexes on agonist-induced signaling is poorly understood. Here we show that preassociation of 5-HT               7               serotonin receptors with G               s               heterotrimers is necessary for agonist-induced signaling. 5-HT               7               receptors in their inactive state associate with G               s               , as these complexes are stabilized by inverse agonists and receptor mutations that favor the inactive state.

Despite the availability of structural information on the inactivated and activated forms of the receptor, the transition processes initiated by the photoabsorption have not been well understood. Here we theoretically examined the photoactivation processes by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free energy geometry optimizations which enabled accurate geometry determination of the ligand molecule in ample statistical conformational samples of the protein. Structures of the intermediate states of the activation process, blue-shifted intermediate and Lumi, as well as the dark state first generated by MD simulations and then refined by the QM/MM free energy geometry optimizations were characterized by large displacement of the {$\beta$}-ionone ring of retinal along with change in the hydrogen bond of the protonated Schiff base. The ab initio calculations of vibrational and electronic spectroscopic properties of those states well reproduced the experimental observations and successfully identified the molecular origins underlying the spectroscopic features. The structural evolution in the formation of the intermediates provides a molecular insight into the efficient activation processes of the receptor.},

Although rhodopsin was originally named as a red-colored pigment for vision, the modern meaning of rhodopsin encompasses photoactive proteins containing a retinal chromophore in animals and microbes. Animal and microbial rhodopsins respectively possess 11-cis and all-trans retinal, respectively. As cofactors bound with their animal and microbial rhodopsin (seven transmembrane {$\alpha$}-helices) environments, 11-cis and alltrans retinal undergo photoisomerization into all-trans and 13-cis retinal forms as part of their functional cycle. While animal rhodopsins are G protein coupled receptors, the function of microbial rhodopsins is highly divergent. Many of the microbial rhodopsins are able to transport ions in a passive or an active manner. These light-gated channels or light-driven pumps represent the main tools for respectively effecting neural excitation and silencing in the emerging field of optogenetics. In this article, the biophysics of rhodopsins and their relationship to optogenetics are reviewed. As history has proven, understanding the molecular mechanism of microbial rhodopsins is a prerequisite for their rational exploitation as the optogenetics tools of the future.},

We further study the generalization performance of our best model by retraining the top layers on the UCF101 Action Recognition dataset and observe significant performance improvements compared to the UCF-101 baseline model (63.3\% up from 43.9\%).},

These techniques include chemical cross-linking (XL-MS), hydroxyl radical footprinting (HRF), Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS), Limited Proteolysis (LiP), Pulse Proteolysis (PP), Stability of Proteins from Rates of Oxidation (SPROX), and Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP). The above techniques all rely on conventional bottom-up proteomics strategies for peptide sequencing and protein identification. However, they have required the development of unconventional proteomic data analysis strategies. Discussed here are the current technical challenges associated with these different data analysis strategies as well as the relative analytical capabilities of the different techniques. The new biophysical capabilities that the above techniques bring to bear on proteomic research are also highlighted in the context of several different application areas in which these techniques have been used, including the study of protein ligand binding interactions (e.g., protein target discovery studies and protein interaction network analyses) and the characterization of biological states.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Nonetheless, recent progress in the crystallographic study of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has provided an unprecedented opportunity for understanding the sophisticated architecture of heptahelical transmembrane (7TM) bundles. These 7TM bundles can respond to a wide range of extracellular stimuli while retaining the common function of binding trimeric G proteins. Here we have systematically analyzed select sets of inactive-like 7TM bundles to highlight the structural conservation of the receptors, in terms of intramolecular C               {$\alpha$}               -C               {$\alpha$}               distances. Distances with the highest scores were found to be dominated by the intrahelical distances of helix III, regardless of the choice of bundles in the set, indicating that the intracellular half of this helix is highly conserved. Unexpectedly, the distances between the cytoplasmic side of helix I and the extracellular region of helix VI provided the largest contribution to the high score populations among the interhelical pairs in most of the selected sets, including class B, C and frizzled receptors. These findings are expected to be valuable in further studies of GPCRs with unknown structure and of other protein families.},

A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity between inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discriminative features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art performance on one-shot classification tasks.},

  abstract = {The configurational analysis of complex natural products by NMR spectroscopy is still a challenging task. The assignment of the relative configuration is usually carried out by analysis of interproton distances from NOESY or ROESY spectra (qualitative or quantitative) and scalar (J) couplings. About 15 years ago, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were introduced as a tool for the configurational determination of small organic molecules. In contrast to NOEs/ROEs which are local parameters (distances up to 400 pm can be detected for small organic molecules), RDCs are global parameters which allow to obtain structural information also from long-range relationships. RDCs have the disadvantage that the sample needs a setup in an alignment medium in order to obtain the required anisotropic environment. Here, we will discuss the configurational analysis of five complex natural products: axinellamine A (1), tetrabromostyloguanidine (2), 3,7-epi-massadine chloride (3), tubocurarine (4), and vincristine (5). Compounds 1\textendash 3 are marine natural products whereas 4 and 5 are from terrestrial sources. The chosen examples will carefully work out the limitations of NOEs/ROEs in the configurational analysis of natural products and will also provide an outlook on the information obtained from RDCs.},

The simulations were employed to calculate equal-time correlations of the fluctuating interaction energy of residue pairs. The resulting interaction-correlation matrix was used to determine a network that couples retinal to the cytoplasmic interface, where transducin binds. Two highly conserved motifs, D(E)RY and NPxxY, were found to have strong interaction correlation with retinal. MD simulations with restraints on each transmembrane helix indicated that the major signal-transduction pathway involves the interdigitating side chains of helices VI and VII. The functional roles of specific residues were elucidated by the calculated effect of retinal isomerization from 11-cis to all-trans on the residue-residue interaction pattern. It is suggested that Glu134 may act as a ``signal amplifier'' and that Asp83 may introduce a threshold to prevent background noise from activating rhodopsin.},

Time-resolved structural biology provides a means to visualize, at near-atomic resolution, the dynamic conformational changes that macromolecules undergo as they function. X-ray free-electron-laser technology has provided a powerful tool to study enzyme mechanisms at atomic resolution, typically in the femtosecond to picosecond timeframe. Complementary to this, recent advances in the resolution obtainable by electron microscopy and the broad range of samples that can be studied make it ideally suited to time-resolved approaches in the microsecond to millisecond timeframe to study large loop and domain motions in biomolecules. Here we describe a cryo-EM grid preparation device that permits rapid mixing, voltage-assisted spraying and vitrification of samples. It is shown that the device produces grids of sufficient ice quality to enable data collection from single grids that results in a sub-4\hspace{0.25em}\AA{} reconstruction. Rapid mixing can be achieved by blot-and-spray or mix-and-spray approaches with a delay of {$\sim$}10\hspace{0.25em}ms, providing greater temporal resolution than previously reported mix-and-spray approaches.},

By now no structural data for archaeal B-family DNA polymerases in a closed, ternary complex are available, which would be the basis for developing next generation nucleotides. We present the ternary crystal structures of KOD and 9\r{}N DNA polymerases complexed with DNA and the incoming dATP. The structures reveal a third metal ion in the active site, which was so far only observed for the eukaryotic B-family DNA polymerase {$\delta$} and no other B-family DNA polymerase. The structures reveal a wide inner channel and numerous interactions with the template strand that provide space for modifications within the enzyme and may account for the high processivity, respectively. The crystal structures provide insights into the superiority over other DNA polymerases concerning the acceptance of modified nucleotides.

  abstract = {We present a new approach to obtain diffeomorphic registrations with large deformations using landmark and intensity information via quasi-conformal maps. The basic idea is to minimize an energy functional involving a Beltrami coefficient term, which measures the distortion of the quasiconformal map. The Beltrami coefficient effectively controls the bijectivity and smoothness of the registration. In this paper, we first propose the quasi-conformal landmark registration (QCLR) algorithm to obtain diffeomorphic (1-1 and onto) registrations between images or surfaces. Using QCLR, landmark-aligned diffeomorphisms between images or surfaces can be obtained, even with a large geometric difference or a large number of landmark constraints. This algorithm is then extended to the quasi-conformal hybrid registration (QCHR) algorithm, which combines landmark and intensity (such as image intensity or surface curvature) information to achieve a more accurate registration result. Experiments have been carried out on both synthetic and real data. Results demonstrate the stability and efficacy of the proposed algorithm to obtain diffeomorphic registrations between images or surfaces.},

Determining the structural dynamics of GPCRs is thus essential both for understanding the physiology of these receptors and for the rational design of GPCRtargeted drugs. Here we review what is currently known about the flexibility and dynamics of GPCRs, as determined through crystallography, spectroscopy, and computer simulations. We first provide an overview of the types of motion exhibited by a GPCR and then discuss GPCR dynamics in the context of ligand binding, activation, allosteric modulation, and biased signaling. Finally, we discuss the implications of GPCR conformational plasticity for drug design.},

  abstract = {X-ray diffraction based microscopy techniques such as High Energy Diffraction Microscopy rely on knowledge of the position of diffraction peaks with high precision. These positions are typically computed by fitting the observed intensities in area detector data to a theoretical peak shape such as pseudo-Voigt. As experiments become more complex and detector technologies evolve, the computational cost of such peak detection and shape fitting becomes the biggest hurdle to the rapid analysis required for real-time feedback during in-situ experiments. To this end, we propose BraggNN, a deep learning-based method that can determine peak positions much more rapidly than conventional pseudo-Voigt peak fitting. When applied to a test dataset, BraggNN gives errors of less than 0.29 and 0.57 pixels, relative to the conventional method, for 75\% and 95\% of the peaks, respectively. When applied to a real experimental dataset, a 3D reconstruction that used peak positions computed by BraggNN yields 15\% better results on average as compared to a reconstruction obtained using peak positions determined using conventional 2D pseudo-Voigt fitting. Recent advances in deep learning method implementations and special-purpose model inference accelerators allow BraggNN to deliver enormous performance improvements relative to the conventional method, running, for example, more than 200 times faster than a conventional method on a consumer-class GPU card with out-of-the-box software.},

  abstract = {Extremely high data rates at modern synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser light source beamlines motivate the use of machine learning methods for data reduction, feature detection, and other purposes. Regardless of the application, the basic concept is the same: data collected in early stages of an experiment, data from past similar experiments, and/or data simulated for the upcoming experiment are used to train machine learning models that, in effect, learn specific characteristics of those data; these models are then used to process subsequent data more efficiently than would general-purpose models that lack knowledge of the specific dataset or data class. Thus, a key challenge is to be able to train models with sufficient rapidity that they can be deployed and used within useful timescales. We describe here how specialized data center AI (DCAI) systems can be used for this purpose through a geographically distributed workflow. Experiments show that although there are data movement cost and service overhead to use remote DCAI systems for DNN training, the turnaround time is still less than 1/30 of using a locally deploy-able GPU.},

  abstract = {The infrared small-dim target detection is one of the key techniques in the infrared search and tracking system. Since the local regions similar to infrared small-dim targets spread over the whole background, exploring the interaction information amongst image features in large-range dependencies to mine the difference between the target and background is crucial for robust detection. However, existing deep learning-based methods are limited by the locality of convolutional neural networks, which impairs the ability to capture large-range dependencies. Additionally, the small-dim appearance of the infrared target makes the detection model highly possible to miss detection. To this end, we propose a robust and general infrared small-dim target detection method with the transformer. We adopt the selfattention mechanism of the transformer to learn the interaction information of image features in a larger range. Moreover, we design a feature enhancement module to learn discriminative features of small-dim targets to avoid miss detection. After that, to avoid the loss of the target information, we adopt a decoder with the U-Net-like skip connection operation to contain more information of small-dim targets. Finally, we get the detection result by a segmentation head. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the obvious superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods and the proposed method has stronger cross-scene generalization and anti-noise performance.},

  abstract = {The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has wreaked unprecedented havoc on global society, in terms of a huge loss of life and burden of morbidity, economic upheaval and social disruption. Yet the sheer magnitude and uniqueness of this event has also spawned a massive mobilization of effort in the scientific community to investigate the virus, to develop therapeutics and vaccines, and to understand the public health impacts. Structural biology has been at the center of these efforts, and so it is advantageous to take an opportunity to reflect on the status of structural science vis-\`a-vis its role in the fight against COVID-19, to register the unprecedented response and to contemplate the role of structural biology in addressing future outbreak threats. As the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaration that COVID-19 is a pandemic has just passed, over 1000 structures of SARS-CoV-2 biomolecules have been deposited in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is rare to obtain a snapshot of such intense effort in the structural biology arena and is of special interest as the 50th anniversary of the PDB is celebrated in 2021. It is additionally timely as it overlaps with a period that has been termed the `resolution revolution' in cryoelectron microscopy (CryoEM). CryoEM has recently become capable of producing biomolecular structures at similar resolutions to those traditionally associated with macromolecular X-ray crystallography. Examining SARS-CoV-2 protein structures that have been deposited in the PDB since the virus was first identified allows a unique window into the power of structural biology and a snapshot of the advantages of the different techniques available, as well as insight into the complementarity of the structural methods.},

For the method to succeed with weakly scattering samples, the diffracted images from a large number of individual proteins need to be averaged. The more the individual proteins differ in structure, the lower the achievable resolution in the final reconstructed image. We use molecular dynamics to simulate two globular proteins in vacuum, fully desolvated as well as with two different solvation layers, at various temperatures. We calculate the diffraction patterns based on the simulations and evaluate the noise in the averaged patterns arising from the structural differences and the surrounding water. Our simulations show that the presence of a minimal water coverage with an average 3 \AA{} thickness will stabilize the protein, reducing the noise associated with structural heterogeneity, whereas additional water will generate more background noise.},

  abstract = {Highly efficient data-collection methods are required for successful macromolecular crystallography (MX) experiments at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). XFEL beamtime is scarce, and the high peak brightness of each XFEL pulse destroys the exposed crystal volume. It is therefore necessary to combine diffraction images from a large number of crystals (hundreds to hundreds of thousands) to obtain a final data set, bringing about sample-refreshment challenges that have previously been unknown to the MX synchrotron community. In view of this experimental complexity, a number of sample delivery methods have emerged, each with specific requirements, drawbacks and advantages. To provide useful selection criteria for future experiments, this review summarizes the currently available sample delivery methods, emphasising the basic principles and the specific sample requirements. Two main approaches to sample delivery are first covered: (i) injector methods with liquid or viscous media and (ii) fixed-target methods using large crystals or using microcrystals inside multi-crystal holders or chips. Additionally, hybrid methods such as acoustic droplet ejection and crystal extraction are covered, which combine the advantages of both fixed-target and injector approaches.},

  abstract = {Crystal structure determination of biological macromolecules using the novel technique of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) is severely limited by the scarcity of X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources. However, recent and future upgrades render microfocus beamlines at synchrotron-radiation sources suitable for room-temperature serial crystallography data collection also. Owing to the longer exposure times that are needed at synchrotrons, serial data collection is termed serial millisecond crystallography (SMX). As a result, the number of SMX experiments is growing rapidly, with a dozen experiments reported so far. Here, the first high-viscosity injector-based SMX experiments carried out at a US synchrotron source, the Advanced Photon Source (APS), are reported. Microcrystals (5\textendash 20\hspace{0.25em}\textmu m) of a wide variety of proteins, including lysozyme, thaumatin, phycocyanin, the human A               2A               adenosine receptor (A               2A               AR), the soluble fragment of the membrane lipoprotein Flpp3 and proteinase K, were screened. Crystals suspended in lipidic cubic phase (LCP) or a high-molecular-weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO; molecular weight 8\hspace{0.25em}000\hspace{0.25em}000) were delivered to the beam using a high-viscosity injector. In-house data-reduction (hit-finding) software developed at APS as well as the SFX data-reduction and analysis software suites               Cheetah               and               CrystFEL               enabled efficient on-site SMX data monitoring, reduction and processing. Complete data sets were collected for A               2A               AR, phycocyanin, Flpp3, proteinase K and lysozyme, and the structures of A               2A               AR, phycocyanin, proteinase K and lysozyme were determined at 3.2, 3.1, 2.65 and 2.05\hspace{0.25em}\AA{} resolution, respectively. The data demonstrate the feasibility of serial millisecond crystallography from 5\textendash 20\hspace{0.25em}\textmu m crystals using a high-viscosity injector at APS. The resolution of the crystal structures obtained in this study was dictated by the current flux density and crystal size, but upcoming developments in beamline optics and the planned APS-U upgrade will increase the intensity by two orders of magnitude. These developments will enable structure determination from smaller and/or weakly diffracting microcrystals.},

The same wedge of reciprocal space was recorded twice by continuous-rotation MicroED from a set of 11 individual crystals. The data from the first pass were merged to make a ``low-dose dataset.'' The data from the second pass were similarly merged to form a ``damaged dataset.'' Differences between these two datasets were used to identify a single heavy-atom site from a Patterson difference map, and initial phases were generated. Finally, the structure was completed by iterative cycles of modeling and refinement.},

  abstract = {In the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP), protein misfolding leads to fatal consequences for cell metabolism and rod and cone cell survival. To stop disease progression, a therapeutic approach focuses on stabilizing inherited protein mutants of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin using pharmacological chaperones (PC) that improve receptor folding and trafficking. In this study, we discovered stabilizing nonretinal small molecules by virtual and thermofluor screening and determined the crystal structure of pharmacologically stabilized opsin at 2.4 \AA{} resolution using one of the stabilizing hits (S-RS1). Chemical modification of S-RS1 and further structural analysis revealed the core binding motif of this class of rhodopsin stabilizers bound at the orthosteric binding site. Furthermore, previously unobserved conformational changes are visible at the intradiscal side of the seven-transmembrane helix bundle. A hallmark of this conformation is an open channel connecting the ligand binding site with the membrane and the intradiscal lumen of rod outer segments. Sufficient in size, the passage permits the exchange of hydrophobic ligands such as retinal. The results broaden our understanding of rhodopsin's conformational flexibility and enable therapeutic drug intervention against rhodopsin-related retinitis pigmentosa.},

  abstract = {Bacterial two-component systems consist of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR). HKs are homodimers that catalyze the autophosphorylation of a histidine residue and the subsequent phosphoryl transfer to its RR partner, triggering an adaptive response. How the HK autokinase and phosphotransferase activities are coordinated remains unclear. Here, we report X-ray structures of the prototypical HK CpxA trapped as a hemi-phosphorylated dimer, and of the receiver domain from the RR partner, CpxR. Our results reveal that the two catalytic reactions can occur simultaneously, one in each protomer of the asymmetric CpxA dimer. Furthermore, the increase of autokinase activity in the presence of phosphotransfer-impaired CpxR put forward the idea of an allosteric switching mechanism, according to which CpxR binding to one CpxA protomer triggers autophosphorylation in the second protomer. The ensuing dynamical model provides a mechanistic explanation of how HKs can efficiently orchestrate two catalytic reactions involving large-scale protein motions.},

To maximize comparability, we used the same batch of micron-sized crystals, the same sample delivery device, and the same data analysis software. Overall figures of merit indicate that the data of both radiation sources are of equivalent quality. For both proteins, reasonable data statistics can be obtained with approximately 5000 room-temperature diffraction images irrespective of the radiation source. The direct comparability of SSX and SFX data indicates that the quality of diffraction data obtained from these samples is linked to the properties of the crystals rather than to the radiation source. Therefore, for other systems with similar properties, time-resolved experiments can be conducted at the radiation source that best matches the desired time resolution.},

The lack of a reliable method for predicting the conformational changes relevant to substrate binding prevents the productive application of computational docking to proteins that undergo large structural rearrangements. Here, we examine how coarse-grained normal mode analysis has been advantageously applied to modeling protein flexibility associated with ligand binding. First, we highlight recent studies that have shown that there is a close agreement between the large-scale collective motions of proteins predicted by elastic network models and the structural changes experimentally observed upon ligand binding. Then, we discuss studies that have exploited the predicted soft modes in docking simulations. Two general strategies are noted: pregeneration of conformational ensembles that are then utilized as input for standard fixed-backbone docking and protein structure deformation along normal modes concurrent to docking. These studies show that the structural changes apparently ``induced'' upon ligand binding occur selectively along the soft modes accessible to the protein prior to ligand binding. They further suggest that proteins offer suitable means of accommodating/facilitating the recognition and binding of their ligand, presumably acquired by evolutionary selection of the suitable three-dimensional structure.},

  abstract = {Mixtures of biological macromolecules are inherently difficult to study using structural methods, as increasing complexity presents new challenges for data analysis. Recently, there has been growing interest in studying evolving mixtures using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in conjunction with time-resolved, high-throughput or chromatography-coupled setups. Deconvolution and interpretation of the resulting datasets, however, are nontrivial when neither the scattering components nor the way in which they evolve are known               a priori               . To address this issue, the               REGALS               method (regularized alternating least squares) is introduced, which incorporates simple expectations about the data as prior knowledge, and utilizes parameterization and regularization to provide robust deconvolution solutions. The restraints used by               REGALS               are general properties such as smoothness of profiles and maximum dimensions of species, making it well suited for exploring datasets with unknown species. Here,               REGALS               is applied to the analysis of experimental data from four types of SAXS experiment: anion-exchange (AEX) coupled SAXS, ligand titration, time-resolved mixing and time-resolved temperature jump. Based on its performance with these challenging datasets, it is anticipated that               REGALS               will be a valuable addition to the SAXS analysis toolkit and enable new experiments. The software is implemented in both MATLAB and Python and is available freely as an open-source software package.},

In bacteria, signal transduction relies on two-component systems (TCS) which comprise a sensor histidine kinase (HK) containing a phosphorylatable catalytic His with phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities over an effector response regulator. Recently, a pH-gated model has been postulated to regulate the phosphatase activity of HisKA HKs based on the pH-dependent rotamer switch of the phosphorylatable His. Here, we have revisited this model from a structural and functional perspective on HK853\textendash RR468 and EnvZ\textendash OmpR TCS, the prototypical HisKA HKs. We have found that the rotamer of His is not influenced by the environmental pH, ruling out a pH-gated model and confirming that the chemistry of the His is responsible for the decrease in the phosphatase activity at acidic pH.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved X-ray crystallography and solution scattering have been successfully conducted on proteins on time-scales down to around 100 ps, set by the duration of the hard X-ray pulses emitted by synchrotron sources. The advent of hard X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs), which emit extremely intense, very brief, coherent X-ray pulses, opens the exciting possibility of time-resolved experiments with femtosecond time resolution on macromolecular structure, in both single crystals and solution. The X-ray pulses emitted by an FEL differ greatly in many properties from those emitted by a synchrotron, in ways that at first glance make time-resolved measurements of X-ray scattering with the required accuracy extremely challenging. This opens up several questions which I consider in this brief overview. Are there likely to be chemically and biologically interesting structural changes to be revealed on the femtosecond time-scale? How shall time-resolved experiments best be designed and conducted to exploit the properties of FELs and overcome challenges that they pose? To date, fast time-resolved reactions have been initiated by a brief laser pulse, which obviously requires that the system under study be light-sensitive. Although this is true for proteins of the visual system and for signalling photoreceptors, it is not naturally the case for most interesting biological systems. To generate more biological targets for time-resolved study, can this limitation be overcome by optogenetic, chemical or other means?},

In this Perspective, we summarize key trends in peptide drug discovery and development, covering the early efforts focused on human hormones, elegant medicinal chemistry and rational design strategies, peptide drugs derived from nature, and major breakthroughs in molecular biology and peptide chemistry that continue to advance the field. We emphasize lessons from earlier approaches that are still relevant today as well as emerging strategies such as integrated venomics and peptide-d isplay libraries that create new avenues for peptide drug discovery. We also discuss the pharmaceutical landscape in which peptide drugs could be particularly valuable and analyse the challenges that need to be addressed for them to reach their full potential.},

At 100 K, the dominant imperfection appeared to be a variation in unit-cell dimensions in the crystal.},

Here, we demonstrate by in vivo and in vitro approaches the presence of an essential [4Fe-4S] cluster in the CysB motif of all four yeast Bfamily DNA polymerases. Loss of the [4Fe-4S] cofactor by cysteine ligand mutagenesis in Pol3 destabilized the CTD and abrogated interaction with the Pol31-Pol32 subunits. Reciprocally, overexpression of accessory subunits increased the amount of CTD-bound Fe-S cluster. This implies an important physiological role of the Fe-S cluster in polymerase complex stabilization. Further, we demonstrate that the Zn-binding CysA motif is required for PCNA-mediated Pol {$\delta$} processivity. Together, our findings show that the function of eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerases crucially depends on different metallocenters for accessory subunit recruitment and for replisome stability.},

In this opinion piece, I argue that these properties of XFEL radiation will facilitate new discoveries in life science. I reason that time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography and time-resolved wide angle X-ray scattering are promising areas of scientific investigation that will be advanced by XFEL capabilities, allowing new scientific questions to be addressed that are not accessible using established methods at storage ring facilities. These questions include visualizing ultrafast protein structural dynamics on the femtosecond to picosecond time-scale, as well as time-resolved diffraction studies of non-cyclic reactions. I argue that these emerging opportunities will stimulate a renaissance of interest in time-resolved structural biochemistry.},

  abstract = {Frizzled (FZD) receptors mediate Wnt signaling in diverse processes ranging from bone growth to stem cell activity. Moreover, high FZD receptor expression at the cell surface contributes to overactive Wnt signaling in subsets of pancreatic, ovarian, gastric, and colorectal tumors. Despite the progress in biochemical understanding of Wnt\textendash FZD receptor interactions, the molecular basis for recognition of Wnt               cis               -unsaturated fatty acyl groups by the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD receptors remains elusive. Here, we determined a crystal structure of human FZD7 CRD unexpectedly bound to a 24-carbon fatty acid. We also report a crystal structure of human FZD5 CRD bound to C16:1               cis               -{$\Delta$}9 unsaturated fatty acid. Both structures reveal a dimeric arrangement of the CRD. The lipid-binding groove exhibits flexibility and spans both monomers, adopting a U-shaped geometry that accommodates the fatty acid. Re-evaluation of the published mouse FZD8 CRD structure reveals that it also shares the same architecture as FZD5 and FZD7 CRDs. Our results define a common molecular mechanism for recognition of the               cis               -unsaturated fatty acyl group, a necessary posttranslational modification of Wnts, by multiple FZD receptors. The fatty acid bridges two CRD monomers, implying that Wnt binding mediates FZD receptor dimerization. Our data uncover possibilities for the arrangement of Wnt\textendash FZD CRD complexes and shed structural insights that could aide in the identification of pharmacological strategies to modulate FZD receptor function.},

Among these, trends in human health have been uncovered through heterogeneous `big data' integration, and disease-associated genes were identified and classified. Along a different front, the dynamic organization of chromatin is being elucidated to gain insight into the fundamental question of genome regulation. Powerful conformational sampling methods have also been developed to yield a detailed molecular view of cellular processes. when combining these methods with the advancements in the modeling of supramolecular assemblies, including those at the membrane, we are finally able to get a glimpse into how cells' actions are regulated. Perhaps most intriguingly, a major thrust is on to decipher the mystery of how the brain is coded. Here, we aim to provide a broad, yet concise, sketch of modern aspects of computational biology, with a special focus on computational structural biology. We attempt to forecast the areas that computational structural biology will embrace in the future and the challenges that it may face.

  abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can modulate diverse signaling pathways, often in a ligand-specific manner. The full range of functionally relevant GPCR conformations is poorly understood. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to characterize the conformational dynamics of the transmembrane core of the b2-adrenergic receptor (b2AR), a prototypical GPCR. We labeled b2AR with 13CH3{$\epsilon$}-methionine and obtained HSQC spectra of unliganded receptor as well as receptor bound to an inverse agonist, an agonist, and a G-protein-mimetic nanobody. These studies provide evidence for conformational states not observed in crystal structures, as well as substantial conformational heterogeneity in agonistand inverse-agonist-bound preparations. They also show that for b2AR, unlike rhodopsin, an agonist alone does not stabilize a fully active conformation, suggesting that the conformational link between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-proteincoupling surface is not rigid. The observed heterogeneity may be important for b2AR's ability to engage multiple signaling and regulatory proteins.},

  abstract = {Background: Ever since the first atomic structure of an enzyme was solved, the discovery of the mechanism and dynamics of reactions catalyzed by biomolecules has been the key goal for the understanding of the molecular processes that drive life on earth. Despite a large number of successful methods for trapping reaction intermediates, the direct observation of an ongoing reaction has been possible only in rare and exceptional cases. Results: Here, we demonstrate a general method for capturing enzyme catalysis ``in action'' by mix-and-inject serial crystallography (MISC). Specifically, we follow the catalytic reaction of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis {$\beta$}-lactamase with the third-generation antibiotic ceftriaxone by time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography. The results reveal, in near atomic detail, antibiotic cleavage and inactivation from 30 ms to 2 s. Conclusions: MISC is a versatile and generally applicable method to investigate reactions of biological macromolecules, some of which are of immense biological significance and might be, in addition, important targets for structure-based drug design. With megahertz X-ray pulse rates expected at the Linac Coherent Light Source II and the European X-ray free-electron laser, multiple, finely spaced time delays can be collected rapidly, allowing a comprehensive description of biomolecular reactions in terms of structure and kinetics from the same set of X-ray data.},

  abstract = {The formation of helices is an ubiquitous phenomenon for molecular structures whether they are biological, organic, or inorganic, in nature. Helical structures have geometrical constraints analogous to closepacking of three-dimensional crystal structures. For helical packing the geometrical constraints involve parameters such as the radius of the helical cylinder, the helical pitch angle, and the helical tube radius. In this communication, the geometrical constraints for single helix, double helix, and for double helices with minor and major grooves are calculated. The results are compared with values from the literature for helical polypeptide backbone structures, the a-, p-, 310-, and c-helices. The a-helices are close to being optimally packed in the sense of efficient use of space, i.e. close-packed. They are also more densely packed than the other three types of helices. For double helices comparisons are made to the A, B, and Z forms of DNA. The helical geometry of the A form is nearly close-packed. The packing density for the B and Z forms of DNA are found to be approximately equal to each other.},

  abstract = {Serial crystallography (SX) technique using synchrotron X-ray allows the visualization of room-temperature crystal structures with low-dose data collection as well as time-resolved molecular dynamics. In an SX experiment, delivery of numerous crystals for X-ray interaction, in a serial manner, is very important. Fixed-target scanning approach has the advantage of dramatically minimizing sample consumption as well as any physical damage to crystal sample, compared to other sample delivery methods. Here, we introduce the simple approach of fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography (FT-SSX) using nylon mesh and enclosed film (NAM)-based sample holder. The NAM-based sample holder consisted of X-ray-transparent nylon-mesh and polyimide film, attached to a magnetic base. This sample holder was mounted to a goniometer head on macromolecular crystallography beamline, and translated along vertical and horizontal directions for raster scanning by the goniometer. Diffraction data were collected in two raster scanning approaches: (i) 100 ms X-ray exposure and 0.011\textdegree{} oscillation at each scan point and (ii) 500 ms X-ray exposure and 0.222\textdegree{} oscillation at each scan point. Using this approach, we determined the room-temperature crystal structures of lysozyme and glucose isomerase at 1.5\textendash 2.0 \AA{} resolution. The sample holder produced negligible X-ray background scattering for data processing. Therefore, the new approach provided an opportunity to perform FT-SSX with high accessibility using macromolecular crystallography beamlines at synchrotron without any special equipment.},

  abstract = {Background: Structure-based drug design is an iterative process, following cycles of structural biology, computer-aided design, synthetic chemistry and bioassay. In favorable circumstances, this process can lead to the structures of hundreds of protein-ligand crystal structures. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations are increasingly being used to further explore the conformational landscape of these complexes. Currently, methods capable of the analysis of ensembles of crystal structures and MD trajectories are limited and usually rely upon least squares superposition of coordinates. Results: Novel methodologies are described for the analysis of multiple structures of a protein. Statistical approaches that rely upon residue equivalence, but not superposition, are developed. Tasks that can be performed include the identification of hinge regions, allosteric conformational changes and transient binding sites. The approaches are tested on crystal structures of CDK2 and other CMGC protein kinases and a simulation of p38{$\alpha$}. Known interaction - conformational change relationships are highlighted but also new ones are revealed. A transient but druggable allosteric pocket in CDK2 is predicted to occur under the CMGC insert. Furthermore, an evolutionarily-conserved conformational link from the location of this pocket, via the {$\alpha$}EF-{$\alpha$}F loop, to phosphorylation sites on the activation loop is discovered. Conclusions: New methodologies are described and validated for the superimposition independent conformational analysis of large collections of structures or simulation snapshots of the same protein. The methodologies are encoded in a Python package called Polyphony, which is released as open source to accompany this paper [http://wrpitt.bitbucket.org/polyphony/].},

Their activation process is accompanied by conformational changes that have not yet been fully uncovered. Here, we carry out a novel comparative analysis of internal structural fluctuations across a variety of receptors from class A GPCRs, which currently has the richest structural coverage. We infer the local mechanical couplings underpinning the receptors' functional dynamics and finally identify those amino acids whose virtual deletion causes a significant softening of the mechanical network. The relevance of these amino acids is demonstrated by their overlap with those known to be crucial for GPCR function, based on static structural criteria. The differences with the latter set allow us to identify those sites whose functional role is more clearly detected by considering dynamical and mechanical properties. Of these sites with a genuine mechanical/dynamical character, the top ranking is amino acid 7x52, a previously unexplored, and experimentally verifiable key site for GPCR conformational response to ligand binding.},

Here, we use solid-state NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on rhodopsin to show that Trp2656.48 within the CWxP motif on transmembrane helix H6 constrains a proline hinge in the inactive state, suggesting that activation results in unraveling of the H6 backbone within this motif, a local change in dynamics that allows helix H6 to swing outward. Notably, Tyr3017.48 within activation switch 2 appears to mimic the negative allosteric sodium ion found in other family A GPCRs, a finding that is broadly relevant to the mechanism of receptor activation.},

A total of 533 a-helices and 644 b-strands were recognized by APSA, whereas DSSP gives 536 and 651 units, respectively. Kinks and distortions were quantified and the boundaries (entry and exit) of secondary structures were classified. Similarity between proteins can be easily quantified using APSA, as was demonstrated for the roll architecture of proteins ubiquitin and spinach ferridoxin. A twenty-by-twenty comparison of all a domains showed that the curvature-torsion patterns generated by APSA provide an accurate and meaningful similarity measurement for secondary, super secondary, and tertiary protein structure. APSA is shown to accurately reflect the conformation of the backbone effectively reducing three-dimensional structure information to two-dimensional representations that are easy to interpret and understand.},

  abstract = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. Using a novel, multi-scale training method the same YOLOv2 model can run at varying sizes, offering an easy tradeoff between speed and accuracy. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

Since room-temperature diffraction experiments naturally demand a large quantity of purified protein, sample economy is critically important for all steps of serial crystallography from crystallization, crystal delivery to data collection. Here we report the development and applications of ``crystal-on-crystal'' devices to facilitate large-scale               in situ               serial diffraction experiments on protein crystals of all sizes \textendash{} large, small, or microscopic. We show that the monocrystalline quartz as a substrate material prevents vapor loss during crystallization and significantly reduces background X-ray scattering. These devices can be readily adopted at XFEL and synchrotron beamlines, which enable efficient delivery of hundreds to millions of crystals to the X-ray beam, with an overall protein consumption per dataset comparable to that of cryocrystallography.},

A polymerase in this family relies on a built-in exonuclease for proofreading. It has not been observed at the atomic resolution how the polymerase advances one nucleotide space on the DNA template strand after a correct nucleotide is incorporated, that is, a process known as translocation. It is even more puzzling how translocation is avoided after the primer strand is excised by the exonuclease and returned back to the polymerase active site once an error occurs. The structural events along the bifurcate pathways of translocation and proofreading have been unwittingly captured by hundreds of structures in Protein Data Bank. This study analyzes all available structures of a representative member in family B and reveals the orchestrated event sequence during translocation and proofreading.},

The molecular events were recorded at high resolution by time-resolved X-ray Laue diffraction as they evolved in real time, from 1 ns to seconds after the laser pulse. The complex structural changes during the photocycle at ambient temperature are displayed in a movie of difference electron density maps relative to the dark state. The step critical to entry into the photocycle is identified as flipping of the carbonyl group of the 4-hydroxycinnamic acid chromophore into an adjacent, hydrophobic environment rather than the concomitant isomerization about the double bond of the chromophore tail. The structural perturbation generated at the chromophore propagates throughout the entire protein as a light-induced ``protein quake'' with its ``epicenter'' at the carbonyl moiety of the chromophore.},

  abstract = {Structural motions along a reaction pathway hold the secret about how a biological macromolecule functions. If each static structure were considered as a snapshot of the protein molecule in action, a large collection of structures would constitute a multidimensional conformational space of an enormous size. Here I present a joint analysis of hundreds of known structures of human hemoglobin in the Protein Data Bank. By applying singular value decomposition to distance matrices of these structures, I demonstrate that this large collection of structural snapshots, derived under a wide range of experimental conditions, arrange orderly along a reaction pathway. The structural motions along this extensive trajectory, including several helical transformations, arrive at a reverse engineered mechanism of the cooperative machinery (Ren, companion article), and shed light on pathological properties of the abnormal homotetrameric hemoglobins from {$\alpha$}-thalassemia. This method of meta-analysis provides a general approach to structural dynamics based on static protein structures in this post genomics era.},

Its a2b2 tetrameric assembly undergoes cooperative binding and releasing of oxygen for superior efficiency and responsiveness. Over past decades, hundreds of hemoglobin structures were determined under a wide range of conditions for investigation of molecular mechanism of cooperativity. Based on a joint analysis of hemoglobin structures in the Protein Data Bank (Ren, companion article), here I present a reverse engineering approach to elucidate how two subunits within each dimer reciprocate identical motions that achieves intradimer cooperativity, how ligand-induced structural signals from two subunits are integrated to drive quaternary rotation, and how the structural environment at the oxygen binding sites alter their binding affinity. This mechanical model reveals the intricate design that achieves the cooperative mechanism and has previously been masked by inconsistent structural fluctuations. A number of competing theories on hemoglobin cooperativity and broader protein allostery are reconciled and unified.},

This Letter presents an in-depth analysis of the serial crystallographic data sets collected by Barends and Schlichting et al. (Science 2015, 350, 445) that probe the ligand photodissociation in carbonmonoxy myoglobin. This analysis reveals electron density changes caused by the formation of high-spin 3d atomic orbitals of the heme iron upon photolysis and their dynamic behaviors within the first few picoseconds. The heme iron is found popping out of and recoiling back into the heme plane in succession. These findings provide long-awaited visual validations for previous works using ultrafast spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Electron density variations are also found largely in the solvent during the first period of a lowfrequency oscillation. This work demonstrates the importance of the analytical methods in detecting and isolating weak, transient signals of electronic changes arising from chemical reactions.},

  abstract = {Structure determination of novel biological macromolecules by X-ray crystallography can be facilitated by the use of small structural fragments, some of only a few residues in length, as effective search models for molecular replacement to overcome the phase problem. Independence from the need for a complete pre-existing model with sequence similarity to the crystallized molecule is the primary appeal of               ARCIMBOLDO               , a suite of programs which employs this               ab initio               algorithm for phase determination. Here, the use of               ARCIMBOLDO               is investigated to overcome the phase problem with the electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) method known as microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). The results support the use of the               ARCIMBOLDO\_SHREDDER               pipeline to provide phasing solutions for a structure of proteinase K from 1.6\hspace{0.25em}\AA{} resolution data using model fragments derived from the structures of proteins sharing a sequence identity of as low as 20\%.               ARCIMBOLDO\_SHREDDER               identified the most accurate polyalanine fragments from a set of distantly related sequence homologues. Alternatively, such templates were extracted in spherical volumes and given internal degrees of freedom to refine towards the target structure. Both modes relied on the rotation function in               Phaser               to identify or refine fragment models and its translation function to place them. Model completion from the placed fragments proceeded through phase combination of partial solutions and/or density modification and main-chain autotracing using               SHELXE               . The combined set of fragments was sufficient to arrive at a solution that resembled that determined by conventional molecular replacement using the known target structure as a search model. This approach obviates the need for a single, complete and highly accurate search model when phasing MicroED data, and permits the evaluation of large fragment libraries for this purpose.},

In bacteria, this process is accomplished by multidomain sensor histidine kinases that undergo autophosphorylation in response to specific stimuli, thereby triggering downstream signaling cascades. However, the molecular mechanism of allosteric activation is not fully understood in these important sensor proteins. Here, we report the full-length crystal structure of a blue light photoreceptor LOV histidine kinase (LOV-HK) involved in light-dependent virulence modulation in the pathogenic bacterium Brucella abortus. Joint analyses of dark and light structures determined in different signaling states have shown that LOV-HK transitions from a symmetric dark structure to a highly asymmetric light state. The initial local and subtle structural signal originated in the chromophore-binding LOV domain alters the dimer asymmetry via a coiled-coil rotary switch and helical bending in the helical spine. These amplified structural changes result in enhanced conformational flexibility and large-scale rearrangements that facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction in the HK domain.},

Whereas plant phytochromes exhibit responses to red and far-red light, CBCRs use the same photoisomerization of a linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore to respond to a wide range of colors. NpR6012g4 from               Nostoc punctiforme               and AnPixJ from               Anabaena               sp. PCC 7120 belong to a large subfamily of red/green CBCRs that exhibit a red-absorbing dark state similar to that of phytochrome but a green-absorbing photoproduct rather than a far-red-absorbing one. In these canonical red/green CBCRs, the photoproduct is blue-shifted relative to the orange absorption observed in the absence of native protein structure. This spectral tuning of the photoproduct requires a conserved Phe residue on the second {$\beta$} strand of the CBCR GAF domain, consistent with a trapped-twist mechanism in which the bilin is sterically constrained in the photoproduct.               N. punctiforme               also produces NpR3784, a CBCR with a similar red/green photocycle to that of NpR6012g4. NpR3784 lacks both the {$\beta$}2 Phe and other residues characteristic of the canonical red/green CBCRs. In the current work, we identify NpR3784 homologs with red/green photocycles in other cyanobacteria. Spectral tuning in this NpR3784 group is accomplished by a different set of conserved Phe residues, including a characteristic Phe residue on {$\beta$}1. This set of Phe residues cannot be interchanged with the Phe residues found in canonical red/green CBCRs such as NpR6012g4. Our results provide new insights into the flexible protein\textendash chromophore interactions used by CBCRs to generate their remarkable spectral diversity.},

  abstract = {Phytochromes are widely occurring red/far-red photoreceptors that utilize a linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore covalently bound within a knotted PAS-GAF domain pair. Cyanobacteria also contain more distant relatives of phytochromes that lack this knot, such as the phytochrome-related cyanobacteriochromes implicated to function as blue/green switchable photoreceptors. In this study, we characterize the cyanobacteriochrome Tlr0924 from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Full-length Tlr0924 exhibits blue/green photoconversion across a broad range of temperatures, including physiologically relevant temperatures for this organism. Spectroscopic characterization of Tlr0924 demonstrates that its green-absorbing state is in equilibrium with a labile, spectrally distinct blue-absorbing species. The photochemically generated blue-absorbing state is in equilibrium with another species absorbing at longer wavelengths, giving a total of 4 states. Cys499 is essential for this behavior, because mutagenesis of this residue results in red-absorbing mutant biliproteins. Characterization of the C499D mutant protein by absorbance and CD spectroscopy supports the conclusion that its bilin chromophore adopts a similar conformation to the red-light-absorbing Pr form of phytochrome. We propose a model photocycle in which Z/E photoisomerization of the 15/16 bond modulates formation of a reversible thioether linkage between Cys499 and C10 of the chromophore, providing the basis for the blue/green switching of cyanobacteriochromes.},

Defocus parameters are estimated by fitting a model of the microscope's contrast transfer function (CTF) to an image's amplitude spectrum. Here we describe modifications to the algorithm which make it significantly faster and more suitable for use with images collected using modern technologies such as dose fractionation and phase plates. We show that this new version preserves the accuracy of the original algorithm while allowing for higher throughput. We also describe a measure of the quality of the fit as a function of spatial frequency and suggest this can be used to define the highest resolution at which CTF oscillations were successfully modeled.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},

  abstract = {A method is described for the processing of X-ray diffraction data collected on an Arndt-Wonacott rotation camera particularly suitable for crystals with very large unit cells. Since often only single exposures can be obtained before the radiation has damaged such crystals, it is essential to select accurately those reflections which have fully penetrated the sphere of reflection. This requires not only a careful refinement of the crystal setting orientation but also a good knowledge of the mosaic spread plus beam divergence. The necessary parameters can be determined by convoluting the theoretically predicted diffraction pattern against the observed film in search of the maximum similarity. Films taken with the crystal misset by as much as 1\textdegree{} can readily be processed with rotational corrections reproducible to better than 0.01\textdegree. The many very weak intensities found in data derived from crystals with very large unit cells can be better measured by using a least-squares fit to a previously determined profile rather than by the usual integration process. Systematic variation of the profile across the surface of the film can be readily accommodated.},

Using PIFu, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method for digitizing highly detailed clothed humans that can infer both 3D surface and texture from a single image, and optionally, multiple input images. Highly intricate shapes, such as hairstyles, clothing, as well as their variations and deformations can be digitized in a unified way. Compared to existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu can produce high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of a person. In particular, it is memory efficient unlike the voxel representation, can handle arbitrary topology, and the resulting surface is spatially aligned with the input image. Furthermore, while previous techniques are designed to process either a single image or multiple views, PIFu extends naturally to arbitrary number of views. We demonstrate high-resolution and robust reconstructions on real world images from the DeepFashion dataset, which contains a variety of challenging clothing types. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public benchmark and outperforms the prior work for clothed human digitization from a single image.},

New multiprocessing frameworks are required to achieve rapid data analysis, as it is important to be able to inspect the data quickly in order to guide the experiment in real time. By utilizing readily available web-serving tools that interact with the Python scripting language, it was possible to implement a high-throughput Bragg-spot analyzer (               cctbx.spotfinder               ) that is presently in use at numerous synchrotron-radiation beamlines. Similarly, Python interoperability enabled the production of a new data-reduction package (               cctbx.xfel               ) for serial femtosecond crystallography experiments at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Future data-reduction efforts will need to focus on specialized problems such as the treatment of diffraction spots on interleaved lattices arising from multi-crystal specimens. In these challenging cases, accurate modeling of close-lying Bragg spots could benefit from the high-performance computing capabilities of graphics-processing units.},

Whereas alternative approaches often rely on user expertise for the tuning of parameters, RELION uses a Bayesian approach to infer parameters of a statistical model from the data. This paper describes developments that reduce the computational costs of the underlying maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, as well as statistical considerations that yield new insights into the accuracy with which the relative orientations of individual particles may be determined. A so-called gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) procedure to prevent overfitting is also described. The resulting implementation yields high-quality reconstructions and reliable resolution estimates with minimal user intervention and at acceptable computational costs.},

To establish the applicability of SVD to crystallographic data, we applied SVD to calculated difference Fourier maps simulating those to be obtained in a timeresolved crystallographic study of photoactive yellow protein. The atomic structures of one dark state and three intermediates were used in qualitatively different kinetic mechanisms to generate time-dependent difference maps at specific time points. Random noise of varying levels in the difference structure factor amplitudes, different extents of reaction initiation, and different numbers of time points were all employed to simulate a range of realistic experimental conditions. Our results show that SVD allows for an unbiased differentiation between signal and noise; a small subset of singular values and vectors represents the signal well, reducing the random noise in the data. Due to this, phase information of the difference structure factors can be obtained. After identifying and fitting a kinetic mechanism, the time-independent structures of the intermediates could be recovered. This demonstrates that SVD will be a powerful tool in the analysis of experimental time-resolved crystallographic data.},

This reaction is highly optimized in the protein, which is ultrafast, selective, and efficient. A great effort was directed to elucidate the mechanism due to the overall complexity of the process inside the protein. The classical one-bond-flip is too demanding in space for the confined protein cavity. Therefore, various space saving mechanisms based on the rotation of multiple double bonds have been proposed. The hybrid quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method played an important role in the elucidation of the mechanism inside the tight protein environment. It allows to take the entire protein into account while describing the ground and excited states of retinal. The predicted mechanisms include full isomerization of two or three double bonds, a simultaneous isomerization of a single and a double bond as well as the partial rotation of bonds adjacent to the central isomerization. This review summarizes mechanistic studies in the literature and compares them.},

  abstract = {For serial femtosecond crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers, which entails collection of single-pulse diffraction patterns from a constantly refreshed supply of microcrystalline sample, delivery of the sample into the X-ray beam path while maintaining low background remains a technical challenge for some experiments, especially where this methodology is applied to relatively low-ordered samples or those difficult to purify and crystallize in large quantities. This work demonstrates a scheme to encapsulate biological samples using polymer thin films and graphene to maintain sample hydration in vacuum conditions. The encapsulated sample is delivered into the X-ray beam on fixed targets for rapid scanning using the Roadrunner fixed-target system towards a long-term goal of low-background measurements on weakly diffracting samples. As a proof of principle, we used microcrystals of the 24\hspace{0.25em}kDa rapid encystment protein (REP24) to provide a benchmark for polymer/graphene sandwich performance. The REP24 microcrystal unit cell obtained from our sandwiched in-vacuum sample was consistent with previously established unit-cell parameters and with those measured by us without encapsulation in humidified helium, indicating that the platform is robust against evaporative losses. While significant scattering from water was observed because of the sample-deposition method, the polymer/graphene sandwich itself was shown to contribute minimally to background scattering.},

Classification algorithms are needed to sort out the single-particle diffraction patterns from the large amount of XFEL experimental data. However, different methods often yield inconsistent results. This study compared the performance of three classification algorithms: convolutional neural network, graph cut and diffusion map manifold embedding methods. The identified single-particle diffraction data of the PR772 virus particles were assembled in the three-dimensional Fourier space for real-space model reconstruction. The comparison showed that these three classification methods lead to different datasets and subsequently result in different electron density maps of the reconstructed models. Interestingly, the common dataset selected by these three methods improved the quality of the merged diffraction volume, as well as the resolutions of the reconstructed maps.},

  abstract = {At the initial stage of the cryo-electron microcopy (cryo-EM) samples irradiated by electrons, the cryo-EM samples suffer from a rapid ``burst'' phase (first 3\textasciitilde 4 e-/\AA 2) of beam induced motion (BIM) which is too fast to be corrected by existing motion correction software, and lowers the quality of the initial frames. Therefore, these least radiation damaged, but ruined frames are commonly excluded or down-weighted during data processing, which reduces the undamaged signals in the reconstruction and decreases the reconstruction resolution by weakening the averaging power. Here, we show that increasing the freezing temperature of cryo-EM samples suppresses the BIM in this phase. The quality of initial frames is partially recovered after BIM correction and is better than that of subsequent frames in certain frames. Incorporating these initial frames into the reconstruction increases the resolution, at an equivalent of \textasciitilde 60\% extra data. Moreover, these frames are least radiation damaged, thus preserves the high quality cryo-EM density of radiation sensitive residues. Such density is usually damaged or very weak in the canonical 3D reconstruction. In addition, we found that a different kind of radiation damage neglected previously occurs in the per-frame reconstruction after the exposure of 2.5 e-/\AA 2. Such radiation damage distorts the density of atoms. The deformation can be avoided by only including the frames from the first 2.5 e-/\AA 2 into the reconstruction. Overall, the high temperature freezing not only provides extra undamaged signal to the reconstruction, but also increases the resolution of the reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Over the past several years, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a leading method for elucidating macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution, rivaling even the established technique of X-ray crystallography. Cryo-EM is now able to probe proteins as small as hemoglobin (64 kDa), while avoiding the crystallization bottleneck entirely. The remarkable success of cryo-EM has called into question the continuing relevance of X-ray methods, particularly crystallography. To say that the future of structural biology is either cryo-EM or crystallography, however, would be misguided. Crystallography remains better suited to yield precise atomic coordinates of macromolecules under a few hundred kDa in size, while the ability to probe larger, potentially more disordered assemblies is a distinct advantage of cryo-EM. Likewise, crystallography is better equipped to provide high-resolution dynamic information as a function of time, temperature, pressure, and other perturbations, whereas cryo-EM offers increasing insight into conformational and energy landscapes, particularly as algorithms to deconvolute conformational heterogeneity become more advanced. Ultimately, the future of both techniques depends on how their individual strengths are utilized to tackle questions on the frontiers of structural biology. Structure determination is just one piece of a much larger puzzle: a central challenge of modern structural biology is to relate structural information to biological function. In this perspective, we share insight from several leaders in the field and examine the unique and complementary ways in which X-ray methods and cryo-EM can shape the future of structural biology.},

The dmax measurement presents equally good or superior results when compared to RMSF, especially for the intrinsically unstructured protein. The clustering method is unique as it relates protein global to local dynamics by providing a global clustering solutions per residue. The methods proposed can be especially useful to the analyses of highly flexible proteins.

Their photochemical properties make them attractive for applications in optogenetics and superresolution microscopy. Phytochromes undergo reversible photoconversion triggered by the               Z               {$\rightleftarrows$}               E               photoisomerization about the double bond in the bilin chromophore. However, it is not fully understood at the molecular level how the protein framework facilitates the complex photoisomerization dynamics. We have studied a single-domain bilin-binding photoreceptor All2699g1 (               Nostoc               sp. PCC 7120) that exhibits photoconversion between the red light-absorbing (P               r               ) and far red-absorbing (P               fr               ) states just like canonical phytochromes. We present the crystal structure and examine the photoisomerization mechanism of the P               r               form as well as the formation of the primary photoproduct Lumi-R using time-resolved spectroscopy and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. We show that the unusually long excited state lifetime (broad lifetime distribution centered at {$\sim$}300 picoseconds) is due to the interactions between the isomerizing pyrrole ring D and an adjacent conserved Tyr142. The decay kinetics shows a strongly distributed character which is imposed by the nonexponential protein dynamics. Our findings offer a mechanistic insight into how the quantum efficiency of the bilin photoisomerization is tuned by the protein environment, thereby providing a structural framework for engineering bilin-based optical agents for imaging and optogenetics applications.},

Prototypical networks learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class. Compared to recent approaches for few-shot learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data regime, and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning. We further extend prototypical networks to zero-shot learning and achieve state-of-theart results on the CU-Birds dataset.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The emergence of high repetition-rate X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) powered by superconducting accelerator technology enables the measurement of significantly more experimental data per day than was previously possible. The European XFEL is expected to provide 27,000 pulses per second, over two orders of magnitude more than any other XFEL. The increased pulse rate is a key enabling factor for single-particle X-ray diffractive imaging, which relies on averaging the weak diffraction signal from single biological particles. Taking full advantage of this new capability requires that all experimental steps, from sample preparation and delivery to the acquisition of diffraction patterns, are compatible with the increased pulse repetition rate. Here, we show that single-particle imaging can be performed using X-ray pulses at megahertz repetition rates. The results obtained pave the way towards exploiting high repetition-rate X-ray free-electron lasers for single-particle imaging at their full repetition rate.},

Radiation damage, comparisons of XFEL and synchrotron work, single-particle diffraction, fast solution scattering, pump\textendash probe studies on photosensitive proteins, mix-and-inject experiments, caged molecules, pH jump and other reaction-initiation methods, and the study of molecular machines are all discussed.

  abstract = {A time-resolved Laue X-ray diffraction technique has been used to explore protein relaxation and ligand migration at room temperature following photolysis of a single crystal of carbon monoxymyoglobin. The CO ligand is photodissociated by a 7.5 ns laser pulse, and the subsequent structural changes are probed by 150 ps or 1 \textmu s X-ray pulses at 14 laser/X-ray delay times, ranging from 1 ns to 1.9 ms. Very fast heme and protein relaxation involving the E and F helices is evident from the data at a 1 ns time delay. The photodissociated CO molecules are detected at two locations: at a distal pocket docking site and at the Xe 1 binding site in the proximal pocket. The population by CO of the primary, distal site peaks at a 1 ns time delay and decays to half the peak value in 70 ns. The secondary, proximal docking site reaches its highest occupancy of 20\% at {$\sim$}100 ns and has a half-life of {$\sim$}10 \textmu s. At {$\sim$}100 ns, all CO molecules are accounted for within the protein: in one of these two docking sites or bound to the heme. Thereafter, the CO molecules migrate to the solvent from which they rebind to deoxymyoglobin in a bimolecular process with a second-order rate coefficient of 4.5 \texttimes{} 105 M-1 s-1. Our results also demonstrate that structural changes as small as 0.2 \AA{} and populations of CO docking sites of 10\% can be detected by time-resolved X-ray diffraction.},

An expansive database of more than 100\,000 protein structures, of which many were determined at resolution better than 2 \AA, is available today. With this achievement, the spotlight in structural biology is shifting from determination of static structures to elucidating dynamic aspects of protein function. A powerful tool for addressing these aspects is timeresolved crystallography, where a genuine biological function is triggered in the crystal with a goal of capturing molecules in action and determining protein kinetics and structures of intermediates (Schmidt et al 2005a Methods Mol.

Biol. 22 651\textendash 9, \v{S}rajer 2014 The Future of Dynamic Structural Science (Berlin: Springer) pp 237\textendash 51). In this approach, short and intense x-ray pulses are used to probe intermediates in real time and at room temperature, in an ongoing reaction that is initiated synchronously and rapidly in the crystal. Time-resolved macromolecular crystallography with 100\,ps time resolution at synchrotron x-ray sources is in its mature phase today, particularly for studies of reversible, light-initiated reactions. The advent of the new free electron lasers for hard x-rays (XFELs; 5\textendash 20\,keV), which provide exceptionally intense, femtosecond x-ray pulses, marks a new frontier for time-resolved crystallography. The exploration of ultra-fast events becomes possible in high-resolution structural detail, on sub-picosecond time scales (Tenboer et al 2014 Science 346 1242\textendash 6, Barends et al 2015 Science 350 445\textendash 50, Pande et al 2016 Science 352 725\textendash 9). We review here state-of-the-art time-resolved crystallographic experiments both at synchrotrons and XFELs. We also outline challenges and further developments necessary to broaden the application of these methods to many important proteins and enzymes of biomedical relevance.},

In crystals of phycocyanin used in this study, the hexamers are offset rather than aligned as in other phycocyanins that have been crystallized to date. Analysis of this crystal's unique packing leads to a proposal for phycobilisome assembly in vivo and for a more prominent role for chromophore NL-155.

  abstract = {A new approach for collecting data from many hundreds of thousands of microcrystals using X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser has recently been developed. Referred to as serial crystallography, diffraction patterns are recorded at a constant rate as a suspension of protein crystals flows across the path of an X-ray beam. Events that by chance contain single-crystal diffraction patterns are retained, then indexed and merged to form a three-dimensional set of reflection intensities for structure determination. This approach relies upon several innovations: an intense X-ray beam; a fast detector system; a means to rapidly flow a suspension of crystals across the X-ray beam; and the computational infrastructure to process the large volume of data. Originally conceived for radiation-damage-free measurements with ultrafast X-ray pulses, the same methods can be employed with synchrotron radiation. As in powder diffraction, the averaging of thousands of observations per Bragg peak may improve the ratio of signal to noise of low-dose exposures. Here, it is shown that this paradigm can be implemented for room-temperature data collection using synchrotron radiation and exposure times of less than 3\hspace{0.25em}ms. Using lysozyme microcrystals as a model system, over 40\,000 single-crystal diffraction patterns were obtained and merged to produce a structural model that could be refined to 2.1\hspace{0.25em}\AA{} resolution. The resulting electron density is in excellent agreement with that obtained using standard X-ray data collection techniques. With further improvements the method is well suited for even shorter exposures at future and upgraded synchrotron radiation facilities that may deliver beams with 1000 times higher brightness than they currently produce.},

To reach high resolution, an iterative refinement procedure using an expectation maximization algorithm is often used that leads to a more accurate alignment of the positional and orientational parameters for each particle. We show here the results of refinement algorithms that use a phase residual, a linear correlation coefficient, or a weighted correlation coefficient to align individual particles. The algorithms were applied to computer-generated data sets that contained projections from model structures, as well as noise. The algorithms show different degrees of over-fitting, especially at high resolution where the signal is weak. We demonstrate that the degree of over-fitting is reduced with a weighting scheme that depends on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data. The weighting also improves the accuracy of resolution measurement by the commonly used Fourier shell correlation. The performance of the refinement algorithms is compared to that using a maximum likelihood approach. The weighted correlation coefficient was implemented in the computer program FREALIGN.},

Macromolecular neutron crystallography, however, remains limited, in part owing to the challenge of integrating peak shapes from pulsed-source experiments. To advance existing software, this article demonstrates the use of machine learning to refine peak locations, predict peak shapes and yield more accurate integrated intensities when applied to whole data sets from a protein crystal. The artificial neural network, based on the U-Net architecture commonly used for image segmentation, is trained using about 100\hspace{0.25em}000 simulated training peaks derived from strong peaks. After 100 training epochs (a round of training over the whole data set broken into smaller batches), training converges and achieves a Dice coefficient of around 65\%, in contrast to just 15\% for negative control data sets. Integrating whole peak sets using the neural network yields improved intensity statistics compared with other integration methods, including               k               -nearest neighbours. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that neural networks can learn peak shapes and be used to integrate Bragg peaks. It is expected that integration using neural networks can be further developed to increase the quality of neutron, electron and X-ray crystallography data.},

Improving upon this is a significant challenge which has been the focus of a global single particle imaging (SPI) initiative launched in December 2014 at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, USA. A roadmap was outlined, and significant multi-disciplinary effort has since been devoted to work on the technical challenges of SPI such as radiation damage, beam characterization, beamline instrumentation and optics, sample preparation and delivery and algorithm development at multiple institutions involved in the SPI initiative. Currently, the SPI initiative has achieved 3D imaging of rice dwarf virus (RDV) and coliphage PR772 viruses at \textasciitilde 10 nm resolution by using soft X-ray FEL pulses at the Atomic Molecular and Optical (AMO) instrument of LCLS. Meanwhile, diffraction patterns with signal above noise up to the corner of the detector with a resolution of \textasciitilde 6 \AA ngstr\"om (\AA ) were also recorded with hard X-rays at the Coherent X-ray Imaging (CXI) instrument, also at LCLS. Achieving atomic resolution is truly a grand challenge and there is still a long way to go in light of recent developments in electron microscopy. However, the potential for studying dynamics at physiological conditions and capturing ultrafast biological, chemical and physical processes represents a tremendous potential application, attracting continued interest in pursuing further method development. In this paper, we give a brief introduction of SPI developments and look ahead to further method development.},

These statistical methods are based on evolution-directed amino acid variation responding to structural and functional constraints in proteins. The identified residues form a basis for determining structure and folding of proteins as well as inferring mechanisms of protein function. When applied to two-component systems, several research groups have shown they can be used to identify the amino acid interactions between response regulators and histidine kinases and the specificity therein. Recently, statistical studies between the HisKA and HATPase-ATP-binding domains of histidine kinases identified amino acid interactions for both the inactive and the active catalytic states of such kinases. The identified interactions generated a model structure for the domain conformation of the active state. This conformation requires an unwinding of a portion of the C-terminal helix of the HisKA domain that destroys the inactive state residue contacts and suggests how signal-binding determines the equilibrium between the inactive and active states of histidine kinases. The rapidly accumulating protein sequence databases from genome, metagenome and microbiome studies are an important resource for functional and structural understanding of proteins and protein complexes in microbes.},

The number of sequences in UniProtKB has risen to approximately 190 million, despite continued work to reduce sequence redundancy at the proteome level. We have adopted new methods of assessing proteome completeness and quality. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to add to reviewed entries and supplement these in unreviewed entries with annotations provided by automated systems such as the newly implemented Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a credit-based publication submission interface to allow the community to contribute publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how UniProtKB responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a dedicated portal. UniProt resources are available under a CC-BY (4.0) license via the web at https://www.uniprot.org/.},

Histidine kinases (HK) are the sensory component, transferring information toward downstream response regulators (RR). HKs transfer phosphoryl groups to their specific RRs, but also dephosphorylate them, overall ensuring proper signaling. The mechanisms by which HKs discriminate between such disparate directions, are yet unknown. We now disclose crystal structures of the HK:RR complex DesK:DesR from Bacillus subtilis, comprising snapshots of the phosphotransfer and the dephosphorylation reactions. The HK dictates the reactional outcome through conformational rearrangements that include the reactive histidine. The phosphotransfer center is asymmetric, poised for dissociative nucleophilic substitution. The structural bases of HK phosphatase/phosphotransferase control are uncovered, and the unexpected discovery of a dissociative reactional center, sheds light on the evolution of TCS phosphotransfer reversibility. Our findings should be applicable to a broad range of signaling systems and instrumental in synthetic TCS rewiring.},

GPCRs modulate cell physiology by activating diverse intracellular transducers, prominently heterotrimeric G proteins. The recent surge in structural data has expanded our understanding of GPCR-mediated signal transduction. However, many aspects, including the existence of transient interactions, remain elusive. We present the cryo-EM structure of the light-sensitive GPCR rhodopsin in complex with heterotrimeric Gi. Our density map reveals the receptor C-terminal tail bound to the G{$\beta$} subunit of the G protein, providing a structural foundation for the role of the C-terminal tail in GPCR signaling, and of G{$\beta$} as scaffold for recruiting G{$\alpha$} subunits and G protein-receptor kinases. By comparing available complexes, we found a small set of common anchoring points that are G protein-subtype specific. Taken together, our structure and analysis provide new structural basis for the molecular events of the GPCR signaling pathway.},

At the center of this transduction event lies the formation of a signaling complex between the receptor and G protein. We report the crystal structure of light-sensitive GPCR rhodopsin bound to an engineered mini-G               o               protein. The conformation of the receptor is identical to all previous structures of active rhodopsin, including the complex with arrestin. Thus, rhodopsin seems to adopt predominantly one thermodynamically stable active conformation, effectively acting like a ``structural switch,'' allowing for maximum efficiency in the visual system. Furthermore, our analysis of the well-defined GPCR\textendash G protein interface suggests that the precise position of the carboxyl-terminal ``hook-like'' element of the G protein (its four last residues) relative to the TM7/helix 8 (H8) joint of the receptor is a significant determinant in selective G protein activation.},

This study argues that neglect of this issue is unwarranted, given existing cognitive theories and laws, together with promising results from the cognitive historical analysis of several important scientists. In particular, while the mathematical wizardry of James Clerk Maxwell differed dramatically from the experimental approaches favored by Michael Faraday, Maxwell himself recognized Faraday as ``in reality a mathematician of a very high order,'' and his own work as in some respects a re-representation of Faraday's field theory in analytic terms. The implications of the similarities and differences between the two figures open new perspectives on the cognitive role of mathematics as a learned mode of representation in science.},

  abstract = {Detection of small objects in large swaths of imagery is one of the primary problems in satellite imagery analytics. While object detection in ground-based imagery has benefited from research into new deep learning approaches, transitioning such technology to overhead imagery is nontrivial. Among the challenges is the sheer number of pixels and geographic extent per image: a single DigitalGlobe satellite image encompasses {$>$}64 km2 and over 250 million pixels. Another challenge is that objects of interest are minuscule (often only \textasciitilde 10 pixels in extent), which complicates traditional computer vision techniques. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline (You Only Look Twice, or YOLT) that evaluates satellite images of arbitrary size at a rate of {$>$}0.5 km2/s. The proposed approach can rapidly detect objects of vastly different scales with relatively little training data over multiple sensors. We evaluate large test images at native resolution, and yield scores of F1 {$>$} 0.8 for vehicle localization. We further explore resolution and object size requirements by systematically testing the pipeline at decreasing resolution, and conclude that objects only \textasciitilde 5 pixels in size can still be localized with high confidence. Code is available at https://github.com/CosmiQ/yolt.},

It builds on the previously established serial electron diffraction technique, in which submicrometre-sized crystals are detected using image processing algorithms. Continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) data are collected on each crystal while dynamically tracking the movement of the crystal during rotation using defocused diffraction patterns and applying a set of deflector changes. A typical data collection screens up to 500 crystals per hour, and cRED data are collected from suitable crystals. A data processing pipeline is developed to process the SerialRED data sets. Hierarchical cluster analysis is implemented to group and identify the different phases present in the sample and to find the best matching data sets to be merged for subsequent structure analysis. This method has been successfully applied to a series of zeolites and a beam-sensitive metal\textendash organic framework sample to study its capability for structure determination and refinement. Two multi-phase samples were tested to show that the individual crystal phases can be identified and their structures determined. The results show that refined structures obtained using automatically collected SerialRED data are indistinguishable from those collected manually using the cRED technique. At the same time, SerialRED has lower requirements of expertise in transmission electron microscopy and is less labor intensive, making it a promising high-throughput crystal screening and structure analysis tool.},

We report here the structure of an RB69 pol ternary complex at 1.8 A\r{} resolution, extending the resolution from our previously reported structure at 2.6 A\r{} [Franklin, M. C., et al. (2001) Cell 105, 657-667]. In the structure presented here, a network of five highly ordered, buried water molecules can be seen to interact with the N3 and O2 atoms in the minor groove of the DNA duplex. This structure reveals how the formation of the closed ternary complex eliminates two ordered water molecules, which are responsible for a kink in helix P in the apo structure. In addition, three pairs of polar-nonpolar interactions have been observed between (i) the CR hydrogen of G568 and the N3 atom of the dG templating base, (ii) the O50 and C5 atoms of the incoming dCTP, and (iii) the OH group of S565 and the aromatic face of the dG templating base. These interactions are optimized in the dehydrated environment that envelops Watson-Crick nascent base pairs and serve to enhance base selectivity in wildtype RB69 pol.},

  abstract = {Two-component systems (TCSs) are important for the adaptation and survival of bacteria and fungi under stress conditions. A TCS is often composed of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase (SK) and a response regulator (RR), which are relayed through sequential phosphorylation steps. However, the mechanism for how an SK is switched on in response to environmental stimuli remains obscure. Here, we report the crystal structure of a complete cytoplasmic portion of an SK, VicK from Streptococcus mutans. The overall structure of VicK is a long-rod dimer that anchors four connected domains: HAMP, Per-ARNT-SIM (PAS), DHp, and catalytic and ATP binding domain (CA). The HAMP, a signal transducer, and the PAS domain, major sensor, adopt canonical folds with dyad symmetry. In contrast, the dimer of the DHp and CA domains is asymmetric because of different helical bends in the DHp domain and spatial positions of the CA domains. Moreover, a conserved proline, which is adjacent to the phosphoryl acceptor histidine, contributes to helical bending, which is essential for the autokinase and phosphatase activities. Together, the elegant architecture of VicK with a signal transducer and sensor domain suggests a model where DHp helical bending and a CA swing movement are likely coordinated for autokinase activation.},

  abstract = {Cholesterol is a highly asymmetric lipid molecule. As an essential con- 6 stituent of the cell membrane, cholesterol plays important structural and signaling 7 roles in various biological processes. The first high-resolution crystal structure of a 8 transmembrane protein in complex with cholesterol was a human {$\beta$}2-\-adrenergic 9 receptor structure deposited to the Protein Data Bank in 2007. Since then, the num- 10 ber of the cholesterol-bound crystal structures has grown considerably providing an 11 invaluable resource for obtaining insights into the structural characteristics of cho- 12 lesterol binding. In this work, we examine the spatial and orientation distributions 13 of cholesterol relative to the protein framework in a collection of 73 crystal struc- 14 tures of membrane proteins. To characterize the cholesterol-protein interactions, we 15 apply singular value decomposition to an array of interatomic distances, which 16 allows us to systematically assess the flexibility and variability of cholesterols in 17 transmembrane proteins. Together, this joint analysis reveals the common charac- 18 teristics among the observed cholesterol structures, thereby offering important 19 guidelines for prediction and modification of potential cholesterol binding sites in 20 transmembrane proteins.},

  abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers overcome the problem of radiation damage in protein crystallography and allow structure determination from micro- and nanocrystals at room temperature. To ensure that consecutive X-ray pulses do not probe previously exposed crystals, the sample needs to be replaced with the X-ray repetition rate, which ranges from 120 Hz at warm linac-based free-electron lasers to 1 MHz at superconducting linacs. Liquid injectors are therefore an essential part of a serial femtosecond crystallography experiment at an X-ray free-electron laser. Here, we compare different techniques of injecting microcrystals in solution into the pulsed X-ray beam in vacuum. Sample waste due to mismatch of the liquid flow rate to the X-ray repetition rate can be addressed through various techniques.},

Upon activation by a ligand, the receptor binds to a partner heterotrimeric G protein and promotes exchange of GTP for GDP, leading to dissociation of the G protein into {$\alpha$} and {$\beta\gamma$} subunits that mediate downstream signals. GPCRs can also activate distinct signaling pathways through arrestins. Active states of GPCRs form by small rearrangements of the ligand-binding, or orthosteric, site that are amplified into larger conformational changes. Molecular understanding of the allosteric coupling between ligand binding and G protein or arrestin interaction is emerging from structures of several GPCRs crystallized in inactive and active states, spectroscopic data, and computer simulations. The coupling is loose, rather than concerted, and agonist binding does not fully stabilize the receptor in an active conformation. Distinct intermediates whose populations are shifted by ligands of different efficacies underlie the complex pharmacology of GPCRs.},

  abstract = {The origin of the spectral shift from a red- to a greenabsorbing form in a cyanobacteriochrome, Slr1393g3, was identified by combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. This protein, related to classical phytochromes, carries the open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophore phycocyanobilin. Our calculations reveal that the effective conjugation length in the chromophore becomes shorter upon conversion from the red to the green form. This is related to the planarity of the entire chromophore. A large distortion was found for the terminal pyrrole rings A and D; however, the D ring contributes more strongly to the photoproduct tuning, despite a larger change in the twist of the A ring. Our findings implicate that the D ring twist can be exploited to regulate the absorption of the photoproduct. Hence, mutations that affect the D ring twist can lead to rational tuning of the photoproduct absorption, allowing the tailoring of cyanobacteriochromes for biotechnological applications such as optogenetics and bioimaging.},

  abstract = {Innovative new crystallographic methods are facilitating structural studies from ever smaller crystals of biological macromolecules. In particular, serial X-ray crystallography and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) have emerged as useful methods for obtaining structural information from crystals on the nanometre to micrometre scale. Despite the utility of these methods, their implementation can often be difficult, as they present many challenges that are not encountered in traditional macromolecular crystallography experiments. Here, XFEL serial crystallography experiments and MicroED experiments using batch-grown microcrystals of the enzyme cyclophilin A are described. The results provide a roadmap for researchers hoping to design macromolecular microcrystallography experiments, and they highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods. Specifically, we focus on how the different physical conditions imposed by the sample-preparation and delivery methods required for each type of experiment affect the crystal structure of the enzyme.},

We determined the structure of the human mGlu               1               receptor seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain bound to a negative allosteric modulator, FITM, at a resolution of 2.8 angstroms. The modulator binding site partially overlaps with the orthosteric binding sites of class A GPCRs but is more restricted than most other GPCRs. We observed a parallel 7TM dimer mediated by cholesterols, which suggests that signaling initiated by glutamate's interaction with the extracellular domain might be mediated via 7TM interactions within the full-length receptor dimer. A combination of crystallography, structure-activity relationships, mutagenesis, and full-length dimer modeling provides insights about the allosteric modulation and activation mechanism of class C GPCRs.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose two variational models for semi-supervised clustering of high-dimensional data. The new models produce substantial improvements of the classification accuracy in comparison with the corresponding models without the regional force in cases that the sample rate is relatively low. For the proposed models, the data points are modeled as vertices of a weighted graph, and the labeling function defined on each vertex takes values from the unit simplex, which can be interpreted as the probability of belonging to each class. The algorithm is proposed as a minimization of a convex functional of the labeling function. The first model combines the Rayleigh quotient for the graph Laplacian and a region-force term, and the second one only replaces the Rayleigh quotient with the total variation of the labeling function. The region-force term is calculated by the affinity between each vertex and the training samples, characterizing the conditional probability of each vertex belonging to each class. The numerical methods for solving these two versions of the proposed algorithm are presented, and both are tested on several benchmark data sets such as handwritten digits (MNIST) and moons data. Experiments indicate that the classification accuracy and the computational speed are competitive with the state-of-the-art in multi-class semi-supervised clustering algorithms. Numerical experiments also confirm that the total variation model out performs the Laplacian counter part in most of the tests.},

  abstract = {A key challenge in melanoma diagnosis is the large number of unnecessary biopsies on benign nevi, which requires significant amounts of time and money. To reduce unnecessary biopsies while still accurately detecting melanoma lesions, we propose using Raman spectroscopy as a non-invasive, fast, and inexpensive method for generating a ``second opinion'' for lesions being considered for biopsy. We collected in vivo Raman spectral data in the clinical skin screening setting from 52 patients, including 53 pigmented lesions and 7 melanomas. All lesions underwent biopsies based on clinical evaluation. Principal component analysis and logistic regression models with leave one lesion out cross validation were applied to classify melanoma and pigmented lesions for biopsy recommendations. Our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC) of 0.903 and a specificity of 58.5\% at perfect sensitivity. The number needed to treat for melanoma could have been decreased from 8.6 (60/7) to 4.1 (29/7). This study in a clinical skin screening setting shows the potential of Raman spectroscopy for reducing unnecessary skin biopsies with in vivo Raman data and is a significant step toward the application of Raman spectroscopy for melanoma screening in the clinic.},

Here, we reveal unexpected overlap between signaling and regulation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor by the non-peptide agonist PF 06882961 and GLP-1 that was not observed for another compound, CHU-128. Compounds from these patent series, including PF 06882961, are currently in clinical trials for treatment of type 2 diabetes. High-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal that the binding sites for PF 06882961 and GLP-1 substantially overlap, whereas CHU-128 adopts a unique binding mode with a more open receptor conformation at the extracellular face. Structural differences involving extensive water-mediated hydrogen bond networks could be correlated to functional data to understand how PF 06882961, but not CHU-128, can closely mimic the pharmacological properties of GLP-1. These findings will facilitate rational structure-based discovery of non-peptide agonists targeting class B GPCRs.},

To ensure removal of the entire tumor and minimize removal of healthy tissue, a tool for quick discrimination between cancerous and normal skin is needed. We propose using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to assess tumor margins. We collected two independent clinical datasets. Using a clinical study of 31 patients with 50 NMSC lesions, we trained models including DRS data normalization, a physiological model, parameter selection and logistic regression classifiers. We tested our models on a second clinical dataset of 56 patients with 68 NMSC lesions. Our test results showed the area under the ROC curve of 0.94 for BCC vs normal and 0.90 for SCC vs normal. When applying a threshold selected using the training dataset to the test dataset, for BCC vs normal, specificity is 89\% and sensitivity is 87\%; for SCC vs normal, specificity is 65\% and sensitivity is 97\%. This study indicates that DRS can be potentially used to map the tumor margin prior to surgery and monitor margins during the surgery on the surface of the skin.},

Training such models with set losses imposes the structure of a metric space over sets. We focus on stochastic and underdefined cases, where an incorrectly chosen loss function leads to implausible predictions. Example tasks include conditional point-cloud reconstruction and predicting future states of molecules. In this paper, we propose an alternative to training via set losses by viewing learning as conditional density estimation. Our learning framework fits deep energy-based models and approximates the intractable likelihood with gradient-guided sampling. Furthermore, we propose a stochastically augmented prediction algorithm that enables multiple predictions, reflecting the possible variations in the target set. We empirically demonstrate on a variety of datasets the capability to learn multi-modal densities and produce different plausible predictions. Our approach is competitive with previous set prediction models on standard benchmarks. More importantly, it extends the family of addressable tasks beyond those that have unambiguous predictions.},

TRPM2 is activated by cytosolic Ca2+, phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate and ADP ribose. Here, we present the \textasciitilde 3 \AA{} resolution electron cryo-microscopic structure of TRPM2 from Nematostella vectensis, 63\% similar in sequence to human TRPM2, in the Ca2+-bound closed state. Compared to other TRPM channels, TRPM2 exhibits unique structural features that correlate with its function. The pore is larger and more negatively charged, consistent with its high Ca2+ selectivity and larger conductance. The intracellular Ca2+ binding sites are connected to the pore and cytosol, explaining the unusual dependence of TRPM2 activity on intra- and extracellular Ca2+. In addition, the absence of a post-filter motif is likely the cause of the rapid inactivation of human TRPM2. Together, our cryo-EM and electrophysiology studies provide a molecular understanding of the unique gating mechanism of TRPM2.},

  abstract = {Correction of electron beam-induced sample motion is one of the major factors contributing to the recent resolution breakthroughs in cryo-electron microscopy. Improving the accuracy and efficiency of motion correction can lead to further resolution improvement. Based on observations that the electron beam induces doming of the thin vitreous ice layer, we developed an algorithm to correct anisotropic image motion at the single pixel level across the whole frame, suitable for both single particle and tomographic images. Iterative, patch-based motion detection is combined with spatial and temporal constraints and dose weighting. The multi-GPU accelerated program, MotionCor2, is sufficiently fast to keep up with automated data collection. The result is an exceptionally robust strategy that can work on a wide range of data sets, including those very close to focus or with very short integration times, obviating the need for particle polishing. Application significantly improves Thon ring quality and 3D reconstruction resolution.},

  abstract = {Class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) influence virtually every aspect of human physiology. Understanding receptor activation mechanism is critical for discovering novel therapeutics since about one-third of all marketed drugs target members of this family. GPCR activation is an allosteric process that couples agonist binding to G-protein recruitment, with the hallmark outward movement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6). However, what leads to TM6 movement and the key residue level changes of this movement remain less well understood. Here, we report a framework to quantify conformational changes. By analyzing the conformational changes in 234 structures from 45 class A GPCRs, we discovered a common GPCR activation pathway comprising of 34 residue pairs and 35 residues. The pathway unifies previous findings into a common activation mechanism and strings together the scattered key motifs such as CWxP, DRY, Na+ pocket, NPxxY and PIF, thereby directly linking the bottom of ligand-binding pocket with G-protein coupling region. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments support this proposition and reveal that rational mutations of residues in this pathway can be used to obtain receptors that are constitutively active or inactive. The common activation pathway provides the mechanistic interpretation of constitutively activating, inactivating and disease mutations. As a module responsible for activation, the common pathway allows for decoupling of the evolution of the ligand binding site and G-protein-binding region. Such an architecture might have facilitated GPCRs to emerge as a highly successful family of proteins for signal transduction in nature.},

However, the crystal size optimization process could be time and resource consuming, if it ever happens. Therefore, improved techniques for structure determination using these small crystals is an important strategy in diffraction technology development. Microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) is a technique that uses a cryo-transmission electron microscopy to collect electron diffraction data and determine high-resolution structures from very thin micro- and nanocrystals. In this work, we have used modified LCP and MicroED protocols to analyze crystals embedded in LCP converted by 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol or lipase, including Proteinase K crystals grown in solution, cholesterol crystals, and human adenosine A2A receptor crystals grown in LCP. These results set the stage for the use of MicroED to analyze microcrystalline samples grown in LCP, especially for those highly challenging membrane protein targets.},

Here we present a dataset of 285,944 diffraction patterns from aerosolized Coliphage PR772 virus particles injected into the femtosecond X-ray pulses of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Additional exposures with background information are also deposited. The diffraction data were collected at the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Science Instrument (AMO) of the LCLS in 4 experimental beam times during a period of four years. The photon energy was either 1.2 or 1.7\,keV and the pulse energy was between 2 and 4 mJ in a focal spot of about 1.3               {$\mu$}               m x 1.7               {$\mu$}               m full width at half maximum (FWHM). The X-ray laser pulses captured the particles in random orientations. The data offer insight into aerosolised virus particles in the gas phase, contain information relevant to improving experimental parameters, and provide a basis for developing algorithms for image analysis and reconstruction.},
