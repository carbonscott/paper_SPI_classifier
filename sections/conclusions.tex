\section{Conclusions}

We studied the performance of triplet neural networks on identifying hits in SPI
experiments.  Firstly, we presented strong feasibility of applying our model to
real-time SPI hit classification, which can be trained on a small size dataset
within 15 minutes on a moderate GPU like NVIDIA 1080 Ti.  Secondly, we also
demonstrated decent generalizability of our model in predict \textit{single-hit}
s simulated from various PDBs.  This finding offers opportunities for building a
universal hit classifier when more experimental data are collected from
distinctive biological samples.
