\section{Background (Related work)}

%% Supervised solutions
%% based on neural network models learn from labelled images and provide predicted classification
%% (Shi et al., 2019; Ignatenko et al., 2021).
%%
%% SPI classification is like face recognition, which is why FaceNet idea is applied.  
%% 
%% Few-shot learning??? 
%% Train our model on SPI images simulated using 40+ particles, whose MW is over 380K.  It generalizes to completely new particles of similar MW to 85% accuracy.

%% PDB distribution by Molecular Weight (MW)
