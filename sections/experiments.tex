    % AMO beamline of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the SLAC
    % National Accelerator Laboratory.
    \item Datasets.

    \item Data preprocessing (image, panel, mosaic)
    % prove order doesn't matter in pattern recognition, as a prerequisite for
    % mosaic mode.

    \item Data augmentation (for training, standardize, crop, random).

    \item Human baseline performance (game of hit)

    \item Accuracy-wise, our model has outperformed previous models.  

    \item Less number of images to train the model (need to provide more results
    to justify).  

    \item Limitations.

\end{itemize}
