    \subsection*{Ideas}

    It's interesting to explore the generalizability of the model to new shapes
    of similar size.  Accordingly, the paper about this new networks can also
    diverge into two directions: (1) A paper about application of large
    computing facilities for enabling real-time SPI classification; (2) A paper
    about a generalized model for enabling real-time SPI classification.

    Another interesting thing to look into would be whether the model can
    distinguish sub-classes like 1-hit, 2-hit, 3-hit and 4-hit.  

    \subsection*{Todo}

    $\Box$ Create simulated SPI images from more pdb files.

    $\Box$ Classification of each individual hit classes.  (novel point,
    definitely beat human baseline)
