    I will explore model generalizability in two directions â€” (1) similar size,
    different shapes;  (2) different size, similar shapes (which might be harder
    to find those cases in PDB).  Accordingly, the paper about this new networks
    can also diverge into two directions: (1) A paper about application of large
    computing facilities for enabling real-time SPI classification; (2) A paper
    about a generalized model for enabling real-time SPI classification.
